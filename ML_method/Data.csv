0,DustJar Original-channel,"Exactly what I was expecting when I saw the ads, the buttons are personally just a bit to crouded in my opinion, an arrow that shows and puts away the little icons would be nice but eh, no complaining. Still a wonderful game despite my pickiness. I like penguins, and this was just the right thing for me! It's probably not everyone's cup of tea, but the game play is overall smooth and doesn't seem to interrupt my other or connection flow. Giving it five stars, cus I'm a sucker for penguin waddle",5,1
1,Kim Kenstler,This game is beyond adorable. It's actually the only mobile game that has consistently kept my interest. The art style is wonderful and watching the penguins just go about their day makes me smile. I always buy the seasonal packs as a way of not only getting more cute items for my island but to do what I can to support this game.,5,1
2,Orc Lord,As long as you don't mind and phone can handle running video ads. It's fun and free. Nothing crazy but cute and time killing. Edit #1 : Game is running amazing still after years. Fun ad reasonable prices with a good stream of ways to collect gems. Apple is being annoying with update approvals but the devs are great at letting players know whats going on. Thank you for that.,5,1
3,Lisandra Vignon,This so relaxing and comfortable when y I u are stressed or bored this is fun may take some time but still I love it.atleast it doesn't have as much ads in fact once you watch all gifts = ads they don't pop up anymore!,5,1
4,PopCoKid 749,"I just started this game, and it's really cute!! There aren't any glitches I've run into yet. I have no complaints. The penguins are adorable and I love collecting all the hearts, knowing that they're happy! Lots of penguins, very cute",5,1
5,Luna Dust,"It's very good for what it is: A zero effort, zero stress, clicking game with relaxing music and repetitive actions. I play when I can't sleep but don't want to do anything that'll keep me up.",5,1
6,Giant Evil Baby,"Probably one of the most relaxing mobile games of all time. Just seeing your penguins walking around while building upon your little isle is soothing, especially compared to other mobile games today.",5,1
7,Adrian Vega,Great game. It lost my data but system got it back. I love the animations and what the game is about. I definitely recommend it.,5,1
8,Ashley Rojas,"With every update, they surprise me with something new! Love it. & thank you. So glad to be supporting this game. I love buying the next & new events! 😍",5,1
9,Gabriel Curl,"Calming, good music and good interactive game play would recommend ads are optional but do help annoying how it constantly shows that you can buy stuff all in all great game",5,1
10,Mr Chems,Cute game and real fun and good to kill time I'm glad it's just like the ads keep up the good work,5,1
11,Christie Peaslee,Such an adorable and relaxing game. The soundtrack only adds to the whole experience.,5,1
12,Jake,"I love this game. It's so cute and I am incredibly addicted and will continue to play forever. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of five is because I regrettably purchased the $50 golden submarine with the promise of ""a massive amount of gold every 5 minutes"". The use of the word ""massive"" was laughably misused. The amount of gold after each 5 minutes is less than what you would get for photo missions and over 2000% less than the treasure ship summoning. $50 dollars.",4,1
13,Rose,"it's cute. my biggest criticism of the game is picking up decorations around the habitats. the wait time is long, and it is what it is. but the items only give you a few slots for decorations. some decorations take up a lot of slots to place, so you really struggle placing what you want without going beyond however many slots you have available to decorate with. the capacity wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't such a struggle to expand it. 3.5/5",4,1
14,Yazi,It's a really fun and relaxing game to play. Overall 9/10. I think the only thing that needs to be improved is how fast you earn materials. I recommend that you add a potential online feature where you can make friends and visit their islands and such. It would make it interactive and fun seeing how other players create and decorate their island. Then you could also add a trading or gifting feature with friends that could help with getting materials.,4,1
15,Celena Barton,"So FUN! I don't generally play mobile games as a rule, too many other things to do. However, my daughter found this and felt I would enjoy it because of penguins and the calming music playing in the background. Both my daughters and I play it when we have some downtime or waiting-in-the-car type stuff. Also, the creators keep it fresh and alive, seasonal fun stuff to collect, mini-games to get more goodies, and updates to add more interactive things (like adding neighbors, etc). Love it!",5,1
16,jane smithers,"I love the game a lot. It's fun and relaxing. However, I just don't understand and see the point of crafting in the workshop when you can't even place all your items except for trees because of the capacity limit. It's just a bummer. 3.5/5",3,1
17,Debbie D,"I like the game! great artstyle, but there is alot of adds.But still agreat game!",4,1
18,Nikki Morris,"It's nice but crashes everytime I watch an ad, it won't go back to the board",3,1
19,Forggoton,"Hello, my game keeps crashing and you've told me to clear cache which I've done before, I tried resetting my phone twice and it still crashes apon loading",1,0
20,Gilly Karma,"Runs great. Very relaxing. No massive ad attack in the beginning... Loving that. In the beginning it does NOT hit you with ads at all and asks for reviews...keep that in mind, you might want wait for your review after the ads hit. Still super cute, you control the ads. Going to continue this game for a while...need the calm.",5,1
21,Kendal,"I used to love this game, but now it's so slow and laggy, that I can't stand to play it anymore. I turned the graphics to the lowest setting and even got rid of all my decorations to try and help it, but it just pauses and stutters constantly. So annoying Update: I appreciate the quick response from the devs!",4,1
22,Unstable Penguin,"I love this game. But ever since switching my phone(it broke). I can't get my old data back. I'm still trying but am really disheartened, especially because I spent money on the game.",3,1
23,Kaden Swann,This game is very fun. Such a relaxing game. Nothing crazy or complex about it. As long as you are ok watching ads I would highly recommend.,5,1
24,Brandon Crosby,"Penguin Isle is a very average idle grinder. Nothing about it stands out as far as gameplay goes. The low rating is for ad-related glitches. There are several features locked behind ads (which is fine in my opinion) but the ads cause the game to crash often (around half the time, not hyperbole). The boring nature of the game and the common crashes are enough to warrant such a low rating. I recommend you try a different game.",2,0
25,Tyler Scott,Super fun and love the new updates. Extremely relaxing game that you can play actively or idly,5,1
26,tva il,111621 REALLY liked this game but I cant take it anymore.Constant aggravation from lagging and crashing and features (zoom for instance) just dont work not rec'g credits for ads watched etc.I must have hit a level limit bc everything suddenly takes forever to earn and without requisite increase in money/hearts its not worth mind numbing boredom of waiting to be able to make next moves.Devs get credit for quick replys 3 stars vs 1! 102821 ISSUE RESOLVED! *102521 Game has problems again.,3,1
27,Alex Buchanan,Hey its a fun little game but I can't watch any ads? I've been shown no ads or been able to get some extra rewards by watching them? Strange thing to complain about but the extra rewards would help lol.,3,1
28,Parmar21,Love this game used 2 play it a lot till I got a new phone. The only main problem is quickly you earn materials in the later levels of the game. Overall great game and the baby penguins SO FRIGGIN CUTE!!!,5,1
29,Maria,I love this game but I wish there was a way to get the limited penquins without paying. Like a event that happens like once every few months or something to try to get them? Please consider,4,1
30,Darling Lulu,"I love playing this game! I dont care that I have to watch ads, the graphic is so cute and wonderful I always feel so happy when I get new places!",5,1
31,MyMoochi0514,"The most peaceful game ever thanks....I love my penguins. I am looking forward to your new updates. I'm very excited about your creativity AND what's to come. Considering everything that is happening in the world today, this game gets me out of my head...I LOVE IT!!",5,1
32,AbstracTAssassin,"I love this game but it would be cool if there was some kind of weather and time system, it would make the game 100x more relaxing. Besides that this game is 10/10.",5,1
33,Michelle R.,"The game doesn't run smoothly. Constantly freezes. Jump game doesn't work because it freezes all the time. You watch ads and at the end of the ad, you don't get the promised reward. Game crashes too often also.",1,0
34,Julien B-P,This is a very relaxing and interesting game. I've had it for a couple of days and one thing I noticed is that it crashes about half of the time after I click on something. Is there any way to fix this?,4,1
35,Alejandra Arias,So pretty and I adore the penguins.... you get ads if you want and I love how the soothing the game is overall. Would Recomend!!!❤,5,1
36,Ahmed Qaddoura,It's good but not like other idle you don't get money from disconnected time and you can't get anything unless the game is opened idk if it's a bug or not but for me I only get money when I'm only in game,3,1
37,something something,This game is so relaxing. I love it! If your looking for a game to kill time this is it!,5,1
38,gerdoguy on YouTube,I like this game. It's chill. No forced ads. Easy to understand. I'd recommend.,5,1
39,N N,"Low key fun, just relax and enjoy. And don't play like there is a major goal in mind. But if you are OCD like me there are fun things too",5,1
40,K. Ryan,"Adorable game! Im so addicted to these adorable goofy penguins. The game runs smoothly, and is addicting in a good way! 😄",5,1
41,zeph51,"It is such a cute game to see penguins evolve, and I'm hooked to it. Would recomend this game to anyone having a bad day.",5,1
42,Alexandra Saturniidae,too many ads. a ridiculous amount of ads. I just deleted the game. it's not relaxing at all.,1,0
43,Matthew Griste,Honestly hate mobile games because of the ads but they did it right with this one and I love how calming it is,5,1
44,Kamarius Pannell,This is an excellent game you can relax but also not be stressed money.,5,1
45,richard mason,"I have really enjoyed the game. I do hope that they correct the issue as you continue to obtain new areas to decorate yet the decoration limit doesn't increase as the land mass does. This doesn't make sense and reviewing the other games I play know they are capable of doing this, which is why I have given this a 4 star and not 5",4,1
46,Willow Birman,"Since the most recent update, the hourglass that gives you the money from disconnected time (and double for watching an ad) no longer pops up every time. It used to show every time I'd been out of game for more than 60 seconds (I think) but not it's only showing after at least 30 minutes. I haven't found any mention of this in changes. I can live with that being nerfed, but at least tell us. I was using it to farm gems for the boost tickets, and now it takes longer.",3,1
47,Paige Vinson,Any time you make a penguin it auto switches to camera mode which automatically flips the screen to orientation if you happen to be playing with your phone cocked to the side. Super annoying and no way I could see to turn it off. I don't want to take a pic every time I make something sorry lmao.,3,1
48,James Glenn,"Those of you who are interested in this game, but don't want to make any in-app purchases, DO understand the following warnings: *You will have to watch more ads than what cable television makes you watch. *This game will be a life commitment. *You may actually die of old age before ever getting close to finishing your island. *You may need to include this game in your will, so that anyone who inherits it, may have a chance at finishing what you have started. F2P players, STAY AWAY!",1,0
49,Chris Swickard,"For anyone interested in this game, understand that progress is locked behind either payment or advertisement viewing, which you will be watching dozens if not hundreds of ads per hour. It's a no go for me, but if you love ads and penguins, might work for you? Otherwise a fairly active idle game, it's okay from a gameplay perspective.",1,0
50,Katrina Chamberlain,"Edit: Now I love it and understand the timing for events. Pleasant and adorable mostly idle game. I have to downgrade my rating because there was no warning about what time the holiday event would end. As a new player I was hurrying to get through the event quests, because I could see the date it was ending. I had many unspent gingerbread men because I didn't realize what time it would reset. A warning would have been really useful.",5,1
51,Debra Terry,"REALLY FUN. I don't know why people don't like it. It's perfect but maybe you could add some more icebergs and like you can buy land. It's really easy! You have to earn coins by working and you buy more cool stuff like, hot tubs. You can pick your music to the game and craft trees and furniture to decorate. I think you should try it. It's a lovely game!",5,1
52,Lily Marleen,"Really cute, but too many (or rather too long of) ads - most seem to be the 30 second long ads. Hardly any nice short ones. The game is pretty simple to follow and I like it. Unfortunately, since I've had the app for quite a awhile, there are no more habitat expansions for me to work towards! Please add some new habitats so I can keep playing!",4,1
53,Jessica Wilson,"I love this game so much, especially because my favorite animal is the penguin and has been since I was young. The graphics are really cute and I love all the penguins in the little outfits! The areas are very creative and I love seeing the penguins interact with them! Edit: changed my review since I figured out how to remove trees and stuff to make more room for furniture!",5,1
54,Jess,"One of the few games I've kept for many months. Excellent graphics, very cute, and good balance of gameplay. Keeps me coming back nearly every day but doesn't require it per se. Some ads, but all are optional to get bonuses.",5,1
55,Bridgette H,"i like it a lot, i have beef with the ""word(s) cash"" ad though, the x in the top corner to exit the ad never comes up! i have to force stop the game. doesnt happen w any other ads though. game is adorable and relaxing, penguins are very cool as are the island expansion options❤",5,1
56,Lurkily Esh,"Not bad, but just FYI, I will never pay a subscription fee to remove ads, I'll forgo ad rewards first. Second, stop begging me to take a picture every time I make a penguin. I'm not sharing pictures of a cell phone game with my friends. Stop trying to encourage me to. It's sad.",2,0
57,Ben Edelman,"Good idle game, like it so far, but was recently cheated put of chests and gems as mini games rewards, plus a few other bugs, other than the fact that in order to get absolutely anywhere in the game you need to watch a million ads, pretty good game.",4,1
58,Pink Rose,Fun game but lately has been crashing a lot. Cant even play the game. Please fix. Update: uninstalled and reinstalled fixed the problem. Great game! Wish we had more room available or if able to sell things would be great too.,5,1
59,CocoPlaysGames,"super fun! really relaxing and will have you playing for hours without even realizing it! The graphics are amazing, and all the animals are adorable! I just wish it was slightly easier to get new areas for you penguins after is costs above C",5,1
60,HearTheSage,Really relaxing and fun game. Ads give you rewards and moves the game forward and its very worth it. I love just coming back to the game and even persuaded my boyfriend to get it and now all he talks about are penguins.,5,1
61,Tori Brower,"honestly it keeps turning the app off, i have to constantly close and reopen the app to HOPEFULLY even get more than a minute to play before it shuts itself off again. I've spent a decent amount of money on this game, i absolutely love this game. but i'm leaving the 2.star review because I can't seem to access it 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️",2,0
62,itsakat3120,"Love it. Only complaint is that the game only rewards you for upgrading the fishing spot. And it take BIG bites from your money. So either lower the cost of upgrading the fishing spot, or give rewards for other spots. Other than that, great game. Cute",5,1
63,R Cusick,"Ads don't work after the last update. How are we supposed to ""update habitat 20 times"" nearly every day when you haven't updated the tasks, haven't added new areas to buy, haven't added new penguins to buy, and we're stuck making 1/100th of what it takes to upgrade once per hour? This is ridiculous.",1,0
64,Karen,"Best Penguin game ever! I absolutely love penguins. I love that they give you plenty of time for the special events! You can rest easy you'll get all the cute special event penguins. Such a relaxing idle game, everything is super cute 😍",5,1

Thank you for the great game and also for your great customer service!",5,1
66,Melissa Walker,"Super cute, you can play without buying anything. They do have ads, but they aren't bad, you watch them to get coins n stuff, they don't just pop up",5,1
67,Brandon Im,"Game is great but now I'm getting ads that literally open a new game. That is awful and won't play until you stop those types of ads. Furthermore, it crashes my game and I don't get the reward for watching the ad.",1,0
68,human person,"very cute! normally im not huge on clicker games, but u can upgrade each station almost at once to make it automatic. very relaxing music & aesthetic. i like it! no complaints so far",5,1
69,Lynley Day,"It is the cutest game and I love it so much and you should definitely get it if you like penguins. It genuinely makes me smile so much, they're all so cute :)",5,1
70,Kiaan Vora,"Nice game. Penguins are my favorite animal so this caught my interest. It has good graphics, great gameplay and creativity. But there is one thing that is bad... WHY TF IS THERE SO MANY ADS NOT EVERYTHING THATS FREE NEEDS A ADD!!!!!",4,1
71,David Roda,"Cool game but you need more habitats and space for fixtures. Seems to be a waste to use research points on decreasing habitat and penguin costs when there are no habitats or penguins to purchase, so now i accumulate coins for nothing",3,1
72,Bébé Oiseau,"I like that you can choose when to watch ads and you get good in game rewards for them, rather then just throwing them up whenever. Also, IT'S AN ISLAND WITH PENGUINS!!!",5,1
73,Dianko Torres,I want this to be 5 stars but the only issue I'm having is that when I close the app my penguins do not continue to generate gold. I'll get the notification saying they've made x gold but when I enter the game i haven't gotten anything. Please fix,3,1
74,Chuljin Ahn,"After playing it over a few days, I found that I spent more time waiting for ads to finish, than enjoying something in game, to the point that I question myself, what am I doing, am I one of those penguins making ads money for the developer?",1,0

92,Sean Pajda,Its fun like really fun cause i usally have a lot of time to grind but the reason i dont give it a 5 star is because it is really hard to get only the 5th area and its only the 5th,4,1

105,James Hall,I really like the game it's makes me relax and it's a great game to to have fun it's very funny I love the Penguins and creature it's a great game I love it I hope this review helped out other people,5,1
106,sleepyboi,"I just want to say this is one of my favorite casual games to play ever but a problem I have with it is the total habitat lvl quest. That one specific quest just slow my progress down so much for me, I could barely do anything like upgrading my research tier. Not to mention the game became tedious b/c of that. If you can, please change the quest to something more manageable like idk upgrading this ONE habitat like 20x, not a few hundreds. it can be any random habitat, just make it easier",3,1
107,Melody Hicks,"I kept having a problem where my penguins disappear. I'll have 20 of a kind and suddenly it will be down too 16. It's happened 4 times now, considering they get more and more expensive it's frustrating to keep replacing them. Rewards for every ad you watch is awesome. More space for decorating would be nice. Sometimes the animals glitch and walk in place endlessly. It's a cute game, nice for relaxing.",3,1
108,Andrew O'Neil,"Apparently honest feedback gets deleted. Poor coding, gambling mechanics, inflated in game currency. Is it really worth the cost of a AAA title? No! But you can buy limited edition penguins! So? This game is designed to snatch money from children. These games and their developers are a mere vehicle for advertisers. This game is an insult to penguindom! It's fun until you realize that it's another pay to enjoy title. I am not a bot and will gladly repost my honest critique. Do better.",1,0
109,Dave Gonzales,It's a very relaxing game that you can progress at your own pace. You can have tons of penguins running around doing amusing things like riding a hot air balloon or wearing a Christmas tree. It's very quaint and I enjoyed it a great deal.,5,1
110,Katlyn,Captivating game! Very easy to lose track of time playing this as there is a lot of instant gratification watching the in game currencies rise higher and faster the more you play. Another plus is you get to choose whether you want to watch ads or not (it does benefit you to watch the ads) instead of getting interrupted in the middle of game play. It is also enjoyable to play without making in-game purchases. Definitely recommend if you want to escape from reality for a bit :),5,1
111,Anas Mokhlis,I love this game it's adorable but one problem and that's how much things cost I have to grind so much but it's ok but please just make easier to get the currency,5,1
112,Bren Kapazioni,"Solid for an idle game. I really like it focuses more on full progression rather than constantly demanding prestiges to make progress, and credit where credit is due, it took a very long time to hit a brick wall in said progression. However, that and the shockingly limited customization, due to strict decor limits and to a lesser extent the penguin limit, ultimately made me decide to stop. Still, very nice idle game with a lot of charm and not very much BS to it.",5,1
113,BredCrum,Very cute and wholesome! It can be played offline but can sometimes be buggy offline so i recomend playing it with internet. No ads unless you choose to watch ads and is very cute. Basicly a tycoon game where you build up differeny parts pf the ice which inhabbit penguins which can give you more gold and hearts to buy more penguins and more land. You can craft decoratins to customize ypur island! Would recomend.,5,1
114,brittany breaux,"Edit 7/21/21 I love this game. It's a great way to relax and unwind from a stressful day. 4 star rating because sometimes the ad videos for ship summoning don't always work. 9/10 it works but every once in a while it doesn't. Other than that, I adore this game. I'm up to 245 penguins 😂 my best friends now call me Ingrind the Penguin Lady",4,1
115,Jane,"This is a really sweet and fun game! I rate it 2 stars due to the performance. On multiple occasions the app has crashed while opening certain pages (ex. the workshop). It has also been freezing and crashing nearly every time I watch an ad. This is frustrating because I can't progress in missions that require me to watch ads (ex. pirate ship), and because I will end up watching an ad 3+ times without getting the ad reward, because I have to fully close and restart the app. Besides this, 5 stars.",2,0
116,Jeh Ree,"Cute at first, but relies too much on scaling and forcing the user to watch ads. If you play for more than a couple days, you'll get to a point where you have to watch 10-20 ads to advance. At that point the game stops being fun, and it (the required ad watching) only gets worse.",1,0
117,Breanna Phelan,"Admittedly cute, but infuriating. It's just constantly watching ads, an in-app mini game that glitches/lags constantly even when my Android phone was brand new, and broken ads that force you to reboot the app sometimes as often as every 5 minutes, which I've sent in multiple reports about over the course of many updates and have never been addressed. And now they just focus on decorations I couldn't care less about, rather than adding new lands/penguins/goals/creatures with each update.",3,1
118,Mombie Zombie,"This game is an idle clicker, but it's got beautiful art, relaxing music and sounds and super cute concepts and gameplay! I have really enjoyed myself so far with it and I like that the rewards systems aren't all pay to play you can achieve things with just gameplay! A nice change from other idle click games.",5,1
119,Aniyah Townes,"I love this game it helps keeps me at bay especially since I have anxiety and anger issues I play this game right after something angers me it instally keeps me calm I can't stop playing this game. I adore everything about it I really love the vibe it is soft and calming it isn't like ""OH HEY LOOK"" it is like ""please take my picture""",5,1
120,Ududo Eze,"Excellent long term idle once you get it rolling. Fun to see what is new, and to watch numbers go up. Only gripe is the secondary currency and microtransactions. Same as other games--too many for little return. Else, I enjoy it. Recommend for anyone looking for a once in awhile idle, or something to check semi-regularly.",4,1
121,꧁sleepy Bby꧂,"""Adorable"" was the first word the very second I noticed the game. It's a kawaii single player offline game with very simple but detailed graphics. The reason I gave this review 5 stars was because of how unique the game is. Collect penguins and build small islands such as the hot springs. Buy a employee penguin for the hot springs once unlocked and collect coins and gems to level up your islands and make more of those adorable penguins. Big thanks to the creator for an kawaii game . . . 🤗👏✨",5,1
122,Kowareta Ningyo,I like the game and its very cute but I personally get an issue where watching the ads makes the game crash and then I have to redo the process until it works or I give up. Maybe if I try it in the future this will change but for now its an uninstall.,3,1
123,m. C. dIzZLe,If ads were 10-15 seconds I would've given this more stars. Plus I lost prizes after exiting out of the mail when it wouldn't allow me to claim them.,3,1
124,Bryleigh McCormick,I actually had this game for like 3 months and I really liked it I ended up deleting though because I didn't play it as much anymore but I love the events and playing it. There isn't a lot that you can do offline I feel like so I don't really like that but its whatever. Also it does get really hard to collect money if you play all the time I feel like the only way to be able to get all the money you need in game you need to play consistently or you wont earn money fast enough But its a good game,4,1
125,Sarah H,It's a cute game but I feel like 90% of it is just watching ads/farming money for the creators.,2,0
126,IDontKnowWhoIAm,"This game is fun but the 'mail' system they have for prizes won from mini games sucks. The prislses should just go immediately into your items folder.otherwise there is only about a fifty fifty chance that you will actually get any of your prizes because the mail system keeps likes to glitch. I have lost about half of the gifts I should have received because of this. I hope they fix this because otherwise the gane is pretty great, but the prizes get you much farther in the game.",3,1
127,bri,"I love this game, its fun upgrading land and finding new penguins, and unlike othergames adds dont pop up after everything but like any other game you have to watch adds to earn stuff which isnt that bad, overall i really do recommend this game!",5,1
128,rice,"this app is so cute!! i absolutely love it, it's been so fun so far and i think i will continue to have fun! i definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a game to just relax and look at some cute waddling penguins, keep up the good work!! <3",5,1
129,Comzone lifiry,"All this time, I soon realized it was for nothing. I am getting bored of this game, but surely it was fun at first but the lack of new experienceses and updates make me migrate to the closes things of penguins. Club penguin 3D!",4,1
130,Ariel Kane,This game is really fun and relaxing. You basically just take care of your penguins as they work and collect money for you. Super relaxing- haven't run into a problem yet.,5,1
131,Makayla Kolat,"Cute game, but after a while it takes forever to level up. I wish there were more mini games. However, I do recommend this, its addictive, relaxing, and fun!",4,1
132,Michaela Morrow,"It's a really fun and entertaining game but it randomly closes for no reason and when I try to research, it usually just takes my energy points and doesn't let me have what I chose to research",3,1
133,holly giauque,My whole family loves this game & it's so fun to see how everyone decorates their islands. Looking forward to updates that hopefully will allow more penguins to be created (I'm maxed out at 343) . Fingers are crossed for an actual physical Dino island!! 😊,5,1
134,Quinn,Controls wouldn't work. Couldn't tap anything. Cute concept but sadly didn't go well. (It's not my phone because everything else but the game was working),2,0
135,Squidfizzy,"The game itself is okay, but the amount of ad's you have to sit through for EVERYTHING is ridiculous, so bad it ruins the game.",2,0
136,Nicholas O'Connor,"I enjoyed how peaceful and joyful it is to play this game. You don't need ads to progress, but it does make it go by more quickly. My only suggestion to the creators is to maybe update the habitat evolutions so that when you level up, more things change (vice them adding a few trees in the first 4 levels). Besides that, I would change nothing about this game.",4,1
137,Jason Yarbrough,"Fun game, good for passing time. No need to spend a lot of money, or any money, to accomplish anything. My only complaint is that there is no confirmation for spending diamonds on treasure chests. I accidentally purchased a chest for 200 diamonds because my thumb was too close to the screen when I was scrolling. I was saving those diamonds for my next time purchase and now I don't have the diamonds.",3,1
138,Awkward Commentator,"Penguin's Isle is a slow and advertisement-heavy game. The goal is to develop an island into a penguin paradise. This requires gold, earned through purchasing more land. The problem is the land produces too little gold for decent progress. The pacing is unbearable and the one solution is to watch ads. I don't mind watching ads to speed up a game, but there's no engagement with how it's are implemented here. There's nothing else to do but stare at the penguins and wait to purchase more land. 1/5.",1,0
139,Aaron Le,"This game is exactly as described, a relaxing clicker based around a community of cute penguins. It really is just supposed to be a little game to pass the time, but I've gotten so addicted to it. I unlocked the danger shore (which I think is the last habitat to buy) and am at a loss on what to do next. I think there's some big potential in making some sort of end goal to look forward to. Maybe growing the island could give you some sort of popularity points to spend on some other goal.",5,1
140,Joseph Berman,"You hit a plateau after a bit, even if you use the ads to boost your penguins. You are forced into putting money into the game after that. Edit: The first areas and their levels are easy and quick to obtain. But once you hit Antarctic Base, it suddenly slows down, even using the variety of ads available. I would love to see a better balance implemented so I could continue getting more penguins 😁🐧",1,0
141,Dylan States of America,"The game was very cute and clever, but here are the problems. 1. It was laggy and phone overheats quickly. 2. Fun at first but after a while it felt repetitive. 3. Most of the time used is just grinding coins. 4. Grinding process is so slow it is basically required to constantly watch ads. 5. Ads often freeze the phone so you have to get out and go back in (may only occur to some users. 6. Drains battery too fast.",2,0
142,Dana Larson,"Cute idea but I hate how the only option for the pirate ship and gift box are to watch an ad. I would pay (a one time fee) to hide the ship and box just so I'm not forced to have them hanging in my waters and the only way to get rid of them is to sit through a 30 minute ad. Stop being greedy! Keep this version as the free demo and let us pay a paid version to stop getting the options to sit through ads. Also, what happened to the photos I took? I can't find them anywhere. Pixel 4.",2,0
143,Andrew Robison,"It's another tap tap, wait around and wade through ads game. If those are you're thing and you like penguins go for it. If you don't like penguins I can't imagine any reason you would be reading this review.",3,1
144,EllenNLuke Forever,"Cute idle click game for adults or kids. Just beware that not all of the advertisements are kid friendly- one that plays often in the game is very sexually explicit. I would caution parents against letting kids play this game because of that. The game itself is cute and a bit addicting. Lots of upgrades and coins are collected while you are away. A very easy-going, casual game",4,1
145,Elise,"I love this game; it has a calming soundtrack, charming graphics, and cute animals. But I have a 3 reccomendations: • Islands should be less pricey. It's easy to advance early on, but then you have to wait for weeks to get enough gold. • Purchasing other animals should be clearer. I spent a while wondering how to even get the other type of money to buy a seal. • Upgrading islands and buying penguins should give players more gold. There's almost no difference before and after. Thank you! ♡",3,1
146,Kasey Suzanne,"Cute graphics, and the game has potential, but they missed the mark. There's constant ads, and you have to watch several 30 second ads to progress even slightly. After a while, it's impossible to progress without watching the ads or making in game purchases. Not the sort of relaxing idle game I was hoping for. Can't even pay to get rid of ads. Really disappointed in this game.",2,0
147,Waldir Pimenta,"The graphics and sound are excellent, and the interface is clean and intuitive. But in the end the game mechanics make me feel like I'm just an automaton being trained to click on certain buttons to get virtual points that allow me to upgrade systems that produce more virtual points, and so on… It felt empty, gratuitously addictive, and too limited after a while. Maybe if I was able to play with the environment I was building (make the penguins do stuff, for example) it would be more engaging.",4,1
148,Margo Contreras,"Adorible game with great graphics. Unfortunately, with great graphics comes great problems with a mid-range phone from 3 years ago. The app crashed on me several times in 30 minutes of play. Not the regular gameplay though. This game is powered by ads, which I'm fine with to a certain degree. Many loots from the game requires you to watch an ad, which is where my device began to fail. I don't know whether this is my device or the game, but with my experience of large games, this never happens...",3,1
149,Jod 1,"The game is beautiful, I love the art, but it requires far too much constant upkeep to actually manage and the money makes no sense. I need 600 ""c"" gold to unlock the next habitat but I only have 900 ""b"" gold, and the first habitat upgrades with ""a"" gold. I can't see different types of gold and I can spend hundreds of ""a"" gold without seeing any difference in my total. Nothing in the tutorial explains this, nor do online guides. it's frustrating that I have enough gold but can't buy something.",3,1
150,Taye Mayo,"I agree with some of the other reviews, it's an amazing idea and the graphics are very cute but it's not worth it. This is similar to the game ""Egg Inc"", except development and progression is not only slow but even laughably slower if you try to get through it without eats watching ads. While playing this I pretty much spent more time watching ads to get gifts than I actually did playing the game, it's ridiculous.",2,0
151,Devin Ferguson,"Just an ad viewing machine. This is a relaxing game with soothing ambient music. Perfect for zoning out and de-stressing. However, like a lot of games these days it quickly becomes clear they want you watching ad rolls for points critical to use the game. As the game progresses, the currency system changes exponentially and you must watch more & more ad rolls. There are three different kinds of currencies in the game, some which are so rare, you almost need to purchase them. Shame.",2,0
152,Wade Heidmann,"Peaceful and Relaxing but no ability to customize your world. I played this for several months, Its a great game (you have to watch lots of ads to upgrade your village) and was very therapeutic. My 3 star rating comes more from the inability to customize your world vs. anyone elses. At the end of the day you end up with the same thing as everyone else.",3,1
153,Chris Fyfe II,"Fun visuals and an interesting concept, worth spending some time. Definitely takes several days to collect the resources required to build up after a certain point. A point that I felt came awkwardly fast. At first I was able to play consistently for a day or two, and then all of a sudden I need to wait whole days just for the resources to make one real advancement. Also lots of opportunities for advancement and completing in game objectives require you to watch ads.",4,1
154,Johnny Becnel,"Very addicting at first but after playing it for a few weeks I started to notice some very serious bugs. The biggest being that if you exit the game, without closing it completly, you do not get a returning bonus. The hourglass simply does not show up. In later stages of the game this is the only way to be able to purchase upgrades. Another issue is that whale bonues (the only other way to gain in game currency) do not load properly. TLDR: Very fun at first but underlying issues are a problem.",3,1
155,Collin Pfander,"Maybe it's just my phone, but zooming in and out is very slow and therefore frustrating. There doesn't seem to be any way to auto-collect happiness hearts, so to grind those I need to constantly be on the lookout for them, then make sure I don't misclick on the wrong icon (that thing in the center of the isle). Frustrating and not at all relaxing. Also the app constantly wants me to photograph my penguins. No thanks, I can just google cute penguin pics instead. I played for about ten minutes.",1,0
156,υн/σн !,"I really love this game, it's so much fun and it keeps my attention. I don't mind the ads at all, I like how they give a fair amount of coins/gems/hearts for watching a short ad but the problem with the ads is sometimes they won't load and it will freeze up my game and I can't do anything but sit and wait for it to crash. It gets quite annoying after a while, will you please fix this issue? Other than that this is a great game! Thank you (:",4,1
157,Jon Garland,"Addicting, but gets frusteratingly boring. It had me glued to my phone for the first several habitats, but now I'm to the point where it takes several days to weeks of collecting coins and spawning new penguins to get the next habitat. Also, the ads seem kind of excessive. While you don't have to watch them, the amount of waiting between habitats would be doubled without taking advantage of a LOT of ad-supported rewards.",3,1
158,Lady Phoenyx,"Love this game! So many strategies to use to build the levels/habitats. Short ads that sometimes freeze and don't give rewards but not often. It would be great if there was an option to skip the habitats you don't want to include. I've tried to keep my game humorous and fun. The rocket launch just doesn't seem to fit in for me. It takes up a lot of space, blocks the view of a lot of other more interesting things and adds a somewhat negative vibe to the game for me.",4,1
159,jude !,"Hello, I agree with alot of the people talking about the vast importance of ads in-game. You literally have to watch ads in order to get money faster. Without these ads, it would be so much more relaxing. Also, I would like to add, could you add more animations for the penguins/creatures? I'm currently trying to reach the Antarctic Base, but I would love to see more interaction among the animals. Like maybe they could have families?? Something like that. Anyways, that's all I had to say. 😚✌💖",4,1
160,Curtis Colgate,"This is a great idle game to a point. The ""free to play"" side is easy until high levels. The problem is that the ""pay to play"" versus grind becomes very untenable at stage 14 (the Hot Air Baloon stage). With the ad content, the developers are fine. Hearts drive progress in this game, the # of penguins drive your heart allowance, and at the 14th stage it becomes extremely unbalanced. Even with the packages offered for sale, the game grinds to a halt with its logorithimic evolution in costs.",3,1
161,Zach Riley-Glassman,"Very cute but buggy/unfinished. I love the concept, needs work tho. I won a 6hr boost from a grab bag that I can't access (no inventory?) and wasn't awarded, can't find a use for gems/diamonds, and my promotional grab bag penguin doesn't register in my total penguin count. I love this, I want to throw money at this, but I shouldn't be able to find three bugs/flaws in the first hour of gameplay.",4,1
162,Nicole Carman,"I originally posted my review with 2 stars (bc of how long it took to earn currency) but I'm editing my original review, as I've had more time to play the game. If you build up your habitats and penguin count, it takes hardly any time to build up currency. I've played this adorable game nonstop and love it. I'd love a few extra ways to earn lightning bolts, but that's no big deal. I love watching my little penguins and share screenshots of them on Twitter all the time (@itsnicolecarman).",5,1
163,Angel Rodriguez,"Best game ever, but i wish that it was a little bit easier to progress, as in the habitats being cheaper. Otherwise, great game.",5,1
164,Lael Kittle,"Great game that could be 5/5 dragged down by a tidal wave of ads. This game is fun, relaxing, and super cute. But there are way too many ads. Whenever I have to watch them for a quest I just put my phone down and do something else. I'd rather just be able to pay $10 to remove these ads that could ruin your experience. I only have 2 areas left to unlock and it is already insane how many ads I have to watch to continue the research tree",3,1
165,mc donald trump,"I mean it's a pretty peaceful game, I enjoyed it, till it takes too long to advance and when I'm not on the game you'd think it's an idle game but no it barely gives me anything for the time I was gone after returning. Plus watching ads is another thing. I can barely come across a single game that doesn't have ads to watch. Maybe make the game more idle??? Actually have the time you were gone count towards something.",3,1
166,K,"It suffers from the typical micro transactions and frequent ads these free idle clicker games always have but that is to be expected. The concept is quite cute and relaxing as you expand the habitats and meet new penguins. Aesthetic wise, I do not have any complaints. At some point, I hit a wall with the high costs to upgrade and found it especially difficult to keep up. About a month or so later, I began to lose interest and uninstalled.",4,1
167,ᴅ ᴀ ᴅ ᴅ ʏ,"I absolutely love that it functions like a tap game, but there's no actual tapping involved. It's mostly ads, which don't even bother me b/c the rewards the ads give are worth it and help so much to expand & grow. The penguins & other animal life are just adorable and the music is so relaxing I've actually used it to fall asleep. Overall, it's a relaxing game and I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of games like Tap Tap Abyssrium & My Oasis (except you rarely get stuck from lack of funds).",5,1
168,Matthew St.Amand,"While the game is very pleasant to look at, and quite enjoyable to play... It should honestly be renamed ""ad watching simulator"" since you will not progress anywhere without watching ads more often than you actually play. You even watch ads, to earn currency to buy upgrades, to the rewards you get for watching ads. What kind of insult to your own gameplay is this...",2,0
169,Peter DiPietro,"Not the skill based type of game at all, in fact it's quite the opposite, but it is pleasing to look at and quite surprising how much you can expand. Upgrading habitats while listening to the soft, almost Minecraft-esque piano music is quite a soothing way to pass your time. Almost like having a virtual Zen garden to care of. Earning coins increases exponentially and slowly but surely you get to watch your very own society of penguins flourish. Some even make decorations.. Smart penguins.",4,1
170,Santiago Perez-Shillington,A great pastime game with very good graphics. My main issue with it is offline rewards will only come up about 70% of the time for me. Also the game is way to reliant on ads and should have more focus on the game itself. The under-water camera is a nice touch but the sound effect for it shouldn't blow your ears out every time.,3,1
171,Toxomancer,"Not a bad game. I am not a fan of the fact that watching ads is part of a quest. I do understand the developer does have to make money, but its a have to thing not a watch this ad for this and get x2 or do it this other way. The game is very relaxing and I do really enjoy the graphics as well as the little cute penguins. Its fun just to watch them interact.",3,1
172,Alicia Matson,"PERFECT. I can't say enough. I really love everything about it. I don't mind the ads at all cuz you can choose to watch them or not, when you want to. They aren't automatic. Gameplay is super simple & very relaxing. Easy to understand & learn very quickly. The graphics are adorable, music is peaceful. The value of what you get for watching ads, spending coins, or spending gems is just right, easy to earn, lots of little features that make it great. Customer service is very quick/excellent!",5,1
173,Jorge A. Aguilar,"This is a cash grab, plain and simple. The game increases the amount you need to make by so much that unless you pay it will take days to weeks to reach the amount needed. Ads are nonstop and come basically when you want to do anything and are made so you have to visit the advertiser if you click even a millimeter off. This one is insulting and should be removed.",1,0
174,Cody Shaw,"God, I absolutely adore and love everything about this game. I honestly can't find one flaw or feature I don't like, or / any problems whatsoever!! I love the graphics, the adorable-ness, how calming and relaxing it is, and the fact that you can actually progress and play the game without really having to watch ads or pay money!! (As in, you're given the option whether or not you want to do so, but even if you don't, it's still possible + easy to play!!) I wish I could give it 100 stars! 💗",5,1
175,Aileen Ortega,"I gave it 4 stars at first and now I'm down to 2. It takes too much time to make money and prepare yourself for ads ads and more ads! If you want to make money to upgrade or buy a habitat you HAVE to watch ads and the amount of money and hearts required for it is insane. You have challenges but no matter if you take 20 or 100 pictures you only get 10 diamonds. And you can't buy or upgrade with diamonds. You really don't play, you just watch ads.",2,0
176,Savannah Weber,"Reason why I give this game two stars isn't because the quality is bad or the game is boring. I quite do enjoy the game a lot. It's really fun to play and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Not to mention the music is wonderful, but there's one big main issue about it that I hope gets fixed...this game sucks and drains my battery really fast. I have my phone literally plugged into my wall and it still drains it. I have to restart my whole phone in order for my battery to go up.",2,0
177,Rinn Albright,"God, this game is magical. It's rejuvenating yet relaxing. I just installed this on a whim when I was experiencing bad insomnia and I seriously shed a few tears (maybe a bit of sleep deprivation) but honestly, the sweetest game. I have become way too attached to my little digital penguins. Now though of course I also have a seal friend. I'm a part timer so I don't buy in-app stuff but it's really not necessary to achieve the whole experience the game has to offer. Give it a try!! It's adorable!!",5,1
178,Queen Thunderfist,"Absolutely love this game. It's the only idle game I've liked enough to keep playing. It's got a lot of ads, all optional, but otherwise it's just a really cute, relaxing game with penguins and other arctic friends. The events last a long time so you're not pressured into completing ton of tasks in a single weekend. I'm a big fan of the steady progress this game offers and I never need to buy anything to do so. It's a really polished, enjoyable experience.",5,1
179,CJ Joy,"I love the tranquility and calmness that this game brings. Whenever I'm worrying or panicking, I always find myself opening the game. The music, the little penguins, and all the creatures really make me happy. I can't explain it. The little heart bubbles that appear overtop the penguins bring me joy—for it makes me believe that I made something happy. It makes me feel important. So, from someone with extreme anxiety and minor depression, I leave this game with a wholehearted 5 stars.",5,1
180,Ian Hazelton,"The music is great, and I love the graphics. The ut after a certain point theres literally nothing for you to do except watch ads to speed the money making process. No tapping for money, no anything. Just staring at the screen and waiting to be able to afford stuff. I like the premise, the music, everything else but theres literally nothing to do but watch ads for money now, and I hate that.",3,1
181,Nicole Sparks,"Super cute game, and very relaxing, However, leveling up and obtaining new areas is taking way too long. It should not take me 4 days to unlock the amusement park. The price of each new area is high and I have never had this much trouble or taken this much time on any game to unlock new stuff. Lower the cost of each new area, or give more money per item.",4,1
182,JOn JammyJims,"Yes, if you do want to progress more than 40% into the game you will need to watch at least 30 minutes worth of ads or you can decide to paywall through it to dramatically increase your progress; however unlike most apps you feel genuinely rewarded for your time and money if you decide to invest into penguins. The mechanics, smoothness, and cute animations shows the developers care and your investment isn't just a cash grab. I love these penguins developers please send me a code for more <3",5,1
183,Doug Coull,"A lot better than things like cookie clicker. It feels like cheating though to use penguins, they're unanimously cute. The Humboldt penguins especially. The game runs at 60 fps on high on the Galaxy note 9, and you can do very well in the game without any money and just using occasional ads. It's not enough to break the experience, just a good boost.",5,1
184,Maggie Herrera,"I love this game. Im addicted to these idle/tycoon games. This one is the best though because you can always progress. Usually in most games like this, you hit a point where you can't continue to play because you'd have to spend money to progress. Penguin Isle is fair to their players. Also its so cute and calming!",5,1
185,Angelica P,"Great concept, my first impressions of the game was ""wow, how adorable!"" However, you do need to watch a LOT of ads to advance, you cannot build habitats, level up penguin workers or add more penguins without spending a lot of time watching ads. Thatbprocess alone takes too much time..Also, I wish there was a bit more freedom in choosing how you'd like your habitats to grow and develop...but everything has an order, and there really isn't room for the player's imagination or creativity...",2,0
186,im become pancake,"I really like this game :) beautiful music, adorable animals, and optional ads! I have become very emotionally attached to some of my penguins. it started out as a joke, but now one of them (my seahorse penguin who I named Tempura-san) has had his wife leave him for another man. I send pictures to my friends (they are now somewhat invested as well) but it's still very fun. my only issue is that the ads won't load anymore, and as a result I can't progress my quests. overall, very fun game! :)",5,1
187,Taylor Clark,"I really like this game, would have been 5 stars but there is some kind of glitch where the heart token chests don't give me the amount they say they will. I get maybe 40% of it. I have several screen shots if the developers are interested of before and after showing how many i have, how many it says I'll get after the ad, and then me ending up with only a fraction of that. Quite frustrating.",4,1
188,Nadia Oviedo,"I love Penguin Isle. I've been playing for a long time now. Everything is pretty much perfect except one thing: I hate that the collect hearts quest keeps going up and up. I understand it's to help extend play time. However, it ruins the fun and discourages me from playing. I really don't want to collect 600+ hearts. Maybe after collect 300 hearts, restart with 100 and go up again. I hope there isn't a point where I need to collect a 1000 hearts.",4,1
189,Josh Bradley,"Fun and relaxing, but terribly imbalanced. I love this game, and the start of it had a wonderful balance. It was rewarding without being overbearing and it encouraged pauses to let coins generate. However, after the Hot Air Balloon, the balance of the game breaks. You come after a full day, collect your rewards, and can barely afford a single upgrade, let alone the next tier. I'm keeping it on my phone because I do love the game, but hope the devs update the late stage.",3,1
190,Cara,"So amazing, so relaxing, SO PENGUINS. Love it. You have to be a tiny bit patient but the game play is still interactive. The reviews that seem upset about the ads don't mention that you don't have to actually watch them if you don't want to, they're optional to click on to watch. Sometimes the amount of points are worth it tbh. The point of the game is to watch cute penguins set to relaxing music while tending to your little island , and if that sounds fun then this is the game for you!",5,1
191,Nadeja Simon,"I've tried opening the app multiple times but it won't let me. I thought maybe it was my phone so I refreshed and tried to clear some storage, even though I still have a lot of space but the app still didn't work. Edit: After I saw the response from the developers, I decided to give the app a second chance. This time it worked. It seems like a fun app but I can't help but notice, it's very ad oriented. It's difficult to enjoy a ""relaxing"" game when it feels like you need to watch an ad every 30s",3,1
192,ginger disaster,"This game is amazing!! I absolutely love it. However- my only issue is that I spend my diamonds way too quickly. On accident. I wish there was a pop-up thing asking if you're sure you want to spend your diamonds because I've accidentally clicked the button way too many times and ended up with hardly any left. I can always get more but it takes a while. Other than that, it's a lovely game!",4,1
193,Jeff Takagi,"Game is perfect to pick up for a couple minutes every few hours.. My complaints- Penguins are repetitive in functions. The game runs on ads yet half the time they fail to load. I'd pay 10 bucks today to disable ads forever... just sayin.... biggest complaint tho? Is the ads not working... I watch half an ad in loading, only to have it fail.. I should be rewarded still, the games bugs should not be my problem, it's yours. I clicked the ad, reward me for it..",3,1
194,GillspeeGames,"This game is a great idle game, it's chill (no pun intended) and it's just enjoyable. The graphics are great, sound is great, and the background music is fanominal. But I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the money lable system is weird, like when you have 100 dollars it will say 100a, and when you have 1,000 dollars it says 1000b. But once you get used to it, it's okay, so I hardly recommend this game to anyone and good job game developers. 👍",4,1
195,Clinten Graham,Overall amazing game!! Love the premise and collecting various penguins. Ideas to improve the game is to have more decoration or that some interactive decorations can make low money making places better like the albotrass or dolphins. Another idea is that we can see upgrades to the places as it gets better. Later in the game I'd like to see more opportunities to buy more penguins and have other challenges. Stunt jump is very hard to get to and challenges are entertaining for me .,5,1
196,Austin,"Mostly fun idle game, however every time I launch is says it requires Google play games, I have no desire to install it so I hit cancel every time, and the app launches clearly showing it doesnt require it. Little bit forced on the rewards where some will force you to watch an ad to continue the different rewards, but still an overall fun idle game. Edit: after the reply it was apparent my review wasnt read. I stated I have no desire at all to install it. Updated from 4 to 3 because of this.",3,1
197,tunabeansss,"A lovely and relaxing adorable little game, thank you so much for something so lovely! I wanted to add that I absolutely love how you guys haven't changed how ads work. They're optional, and they progress you very well if you decide to watch them. I wish more games were designed like this, I feel like they would be more successful. Absolutely wonderful job💜",5,1
198,Mya Spradlin,"I give this 4.5 stars. I wish that it was easier to move the screen around. It sort of resists the movement as if your pulling the screen slowly or it's too heavy. However, I was generous and only took off half a star because it's a gorgeous game. The music always makes me fall asleep, so I tend to play it before bed. It is a perfect and calming way to relieve anxiety/stress and simply pass the time. The graphics are beyond beautiful as well.",4,1
199,Jessica G,"It's a cute fun game, however the ads is very excessive. And it's not just me. Just look at all the recent reviews people had posted. They all say the same thing. That it's a cute fun game with nice design but the ads just ruins it all. The only time I don't have to watch an ad is when I'm spending the coins. But any large income that's available I have to watch an ad. Not sure how much longer I'll have this app because it's just too much. It ruins the game.",1,0
200,Alex Sanchez,"It's a nice little thing, but it has so much potential. The models are thought out, the animations are fun but Aside from grinding to the next thing to unlock there's nothing really to keep it going once you get everything. I'd be interested to see this evolve towards a ""tycoon"" type of experience, maybe let us choose what to build and have multiples of the same habitats, freedom to make more islands, let us create and make a unique penguin isles from user to user!",4,1
201,Anthony Scheer,"Cute but some annoying quirks. First, pros: it runs very smooth. It is cute and relaxing. You can unlock lots of different animals. Now, cons: the game limits offline resources gathered to 1.5 hours. You can increase this, but it's tedious. Most similar games start with much more offline resources awarded when you return. Also, I felt like 1/3 of my time in the game was spent watching ads for the bonuses. I'd probably recommend it only to people who really, REALLY like (watching) penguins.",3,1
202,Kunal Patel,"Wow. Just wow. What a beautiful, peaceful, and fun game. I love the concept of making your own island and slowly bulding it into your own penguin world. The progression is fast and satisfying, but not too fast where it gets boring quick. I already have 5 hours on the game and man, its one of the best casual, yet active games I've played in a long time. Thank you developers for this amazing creation.",5,1
203,Robin Powell,"Fun game and excellent tech support, but it requires cell reception (at least initially) for it to fully work. You can play it on Wi-Fi- only devices, but be aware that purchases from the store will fail (the transaction succeeds but you don't receive your purchase) and events and in- game mail won't show up. I still prefer it on my tablet, that just means no more purchasing on my part. It's a shame, because I like to support developers of games I enjoy. Hopefully one day they'll fix that.",4,1
204,Mini,"This game is great and its relaxing to see your penguin empire slowly expand to create an awesome penguin village! But thats the problem... everything happens VERY SLOWLY. Early game its easy to progress but later buying new areas is difficult because they cost so much... I had to save up money for a week in order to buy a new area for the penguins and with how long it takes, its just not worth to continue playing knowing you have to grind for ages in order to upgrade your base...",2,0
205,Billy Bob,"This game is wonderful to just sit down and enjoy. It's such a good way to relax, and watching my little penguin kingdom grow is quite amusing! Not sure why anyone would have a problem with this game. It's slow, but thats how it's supposed to be. If you need constant explosions and gore then please look elsewhere. 10/10, will definitely recommend this to others.",5,1
206,Jimmie Rogers,"Fun game overall, there seems to be an issue with it giving me my offline rewards, however. Sometimes it will show up after my screen has been locked with the game open for 2 minutes. Other times I can go all night without playing and still not get an offline reward. Not that huge of a deal, until it becomes one of your missions. Please correct this issue.",3,1
207,Steven Schrum,I love this game so far but I fear that I'll eventually stop playing due to the high costs it takes to unlock new areas. From the beginning I focused heavily on upgrading my first two-three penguins so that I could maximize the amount of money I was making. Now I'm about a day into playing and I'm having to wait forever just to unlock another area. I think this makes customers loose interest when they have to wait so long. I love everything else.,4,1
208,Anna G.,"The artwork is gorgeous, the music is soothing, and the penguins are adorable! I took a star off because you need to watch ads. You are able to choose not to watch some, but you still have to watch ads frequently in order to advance in level. Out of the 7 ""quests"" they give to level up, 3 of them require you to watch ads to complete them. It's still a very fun game and I hope they come out with more habitats and penguins soon so I can keep progressing!",4,1
209,Luke Rice,"Game is fun and simple. Music is peaceful, though the mood is broken every time an ad plays and I have to scramble to hit the mute button. Would be nice to have option to start those on mute. Also since the last update (Christmas update) the offline reward hasn't worked a single time when I just switch to a different app and come back hours later. I have to force close the game every time I stop playing if I want to get the offline reward when I come back. Please fix!",4,1
210,Andrew K,"I never thought I'd complain about too few ads, but this game has gated progress behind watching ads that don't actually load after a while, almost as if they run out of sponsored views each day. The fact that the game becomes unplayable when ads don't load says a lot about the kind of game it actually is. The art is adorable, and that's the only reason I tolerate it.",2,0
211,Christopher Coronado,"Cute fun game, simple. Not for people in a hurry for the endgame. This is a slow build game, unless you spend some money. The penguins are pretty cool and so are the creatures. Lots of ads for this game if you want to progress in a decent rate. I mean A LOT of ads. The challenges are pretty bland. Its the same 4 i feel like, collect hearts, have *this many* penguins and reach fishing dock *to this level* definitely needs a mix up.",4,1
212,Nikki Schobert,"I've loved this game for a long time. I've never had any issues until recently, where the game doesn't collect money or anything while it's not open on my phone. It's making it very difficult to progress when most of the money I get is no longer showing up. I tried reinstalling, it didn't help. I really want to play this game but the hourglass just doesn't come up anymore.",3,1
213,Lori Krieger,"This game is so cute! Sometimes the tap games can be a bit demanding as you eventually have to tap the screen for a long time to achieve leveling up, but with this game, it truly is, relaxing. And, if you choose to view an add after logging in from the day before, there are facts about the penguins, rather than just another game ad and I really enjoy that! Well done developers :)",5,1
214,LYNDEE,I would have gave this game a 5 star but going down to 2. Reason behind this is because of the save function. I had the game on an iOS but changed my phone to an android and guess what... They CAN NOT move data between the 2 systems. ALL that time played on this game wasted...down the drain.... They said they're working on this but I definitely am NOT going to start the game ALL over again because that'll be just irritate me forsure.,2,0
215,Twighlight,"The game is cute & fun. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because you basically have to watch ads every minute or so to play the game. Like the main game mechanic is watching ads. It's rewarding to make the money and upgrade and get more penguins, but watching so many ads can be a little tedious. It's almost as if the whole game is a cash grab through ad revenue & their shop where you can purchase gems and such to advance in the game. It can be worth it but sometimes it's repetitive.",3,1
216,Advspringbonnie,"This game is great, very fun, and I don't mind the ads. My only problems are that there's a limit of decorations, some points have very slow progression, and that there should maybe be something else to do other than just click, like some sort of minigame that you could play. It does affect battery life a bit when playing, but nothing too serious. Overall, I'd reccomend as a relaxing game.",4,1
217,Drakocopter,"Peaceful and calm. I don't really play idle games, but this one is really good. It's nice and relaxing. No explosions, flashing lights, crazy colors and fonts. Just you and your penguin island. However, what truly makes this app 5 stars and not 4 is how the devs found the perfect balance between ads and gameplay, something that most developers seem to disregard and decide to be greedy instead. Easy 5 stars, I love what you guys have done here.",5,1
218,Yojimbra The great,"An idile management game where you click to get resources so you can make more things that gather automatically. At the start the progression is fast and smooth but eventually it grinds to a halt. It doesn't have the usual reset for a multiplier that similar games have, though I'm not sure if that's a blessing or a curse. Still overall a peaceful game.",4,1
219,Robert Rogier,"This was a somewhat enjoyable idle game, but it has several things that really ruin the fun it could have been. First, it relies on far too many ads. It's almost impossible to progress at all without watching ads every 60-90 seconds. Second, the purchase items are extremely expensive. To skip watching ads for example, is $29.99US PER MONTH. Finally, once you build the rocket pad, there's really nothing else you can do but slowly increase your habitats. There's no end, no rewards, just more ads.",2,0
220,Melinna Rivera,"Love this game. Seriously - its fun, the animations are great, music is soothing. I love it. My ONLY problem right now is that you guys are removing the whale?? Its gorgeous and just thought I should let you know that you should try to find ways to implement it elsewhere or in the future. Put back the whale and you'll get my 5 stars.",4,1
221,Aiden Plemons,"This is an adorable idle click game. I find myself just watching my little penguins sometimes. There isn't all that much to do regarding gameplay, but it is relaxing, and super cute. The ads aren't that bad compared to some other games. I sometimes get ones I can't mute, which can be a bit annoying. I do wish there was a confirmation notification for spending the gems, but the achievements are pretty easy to do for more gems. Overall pretty nice game.",4,1
222,John Haygood,"Very cute game. I complete my daily quests for about 30 mins, watch them move around and then come back the next day with revenue. Ads are not in your face and offer you a decent amount of currency when you do watch them. Good job, developers! This game serves as a nice aesthetic pleasure to my life.",5,1
223,Gusduhguy,This game is amazing. I never leave google reviews for apps but this game is just incredible. Its so much fun that I have gotten all my friends to play it with me. Its super satisfying to watch your base grow. I like the idea of collecting a large variety of penguins. Another thing that is great is they always have an event going on. It never gets boring and the reward is satisfying because you get to keep them in your island. I would recomend this game to anyone. Its so much fun,5,1
224,Ronnie Davidson,"This game could be a lot of fun except for the ads! And this isn't your typical ad complaint ""waaa there are too many ads"" Ads pay for games people, if you want to play free watch ads. My complaint is that the ads don't load! You give me a bunch of ways to improve my island with ads but then it takes me 20 minutes to get them to start working. I can't believe that I am going to STOP playing a game because I can't watch ads. It is infuriating. Also apparently the music is calming, I dunno on mute",3,1
225,Lisa Davis,"I attempted to purchase gems 4 days ago. After my payment processed, no gems were applied. I sent a pleasant to email to the company to explain the situation and was advised that they would give gems after requesting screenshots and proof. Here we are 18 emails later. I had requested numerous times to have the gems added to the game so that I may use them, considering that I paid for them. I have now requested at least three times for them to refund my money. I have uninstalled the game. A waste",1,0
226,Alex Bristol,"Great game with cute penguins! If you like games with an awesome esthetic, soothing music and light resources management, than this is the game for you! I also love that you don't have to spend money, and if you want, you can open chests without paying and just watch a short ad instead! Never felt like I needed to, but I don't mind watching a few sometimes. :)",5,1
227,Mishelle Madison,"I actually like this more than i thought i would. I am a penguin lover so it caught my attention. Theres lots of rewards, upgrades and things to do in the game as well as gaining gold and hearts while idle. I would say adding more controls such as sound effects option and better graphics would improve game play. Also my husband has it downloaded on his galaxy note 3 and none of the adds will play for him so no add rewards, he's rather disapointed. Also add a zoom the penguins are so small",4,1
228,- DAGGERSFIELD -,"It's a cute game, but the amount of ads is overwhelming and kind of ruins it. Feels like I have to watch an ad for every single thing at this point, and they're not short ones. I don't know if it's because of the large amount of ads, but this is also the only game I have an issue with overheating my phone... and it's supposed to be a relaxing game about artic birds. I play RPGs with much more intense gameplay, but it's only this one game that kills my battery and overheats my phone (Galaxy S9).",2,0
229,Ethan Culp,"TL;DR: a gorgeous tapfest. Next to Monument Valley, this is probably the cutest game in the store. The gameplay is an insanely addictive tapfest as you build up the penguins' habitats. Watching them interact and fall down is super funny. While the graphics make the game a must-have, the amount ads diminish what could be a perfect game. After completing 80% of the game, I think having an option to pay $5.99 one-time or something to get rid of the ads and keep the function they provide would be a huge help for the players. For those interested, it takes about 2 months of dedication and oversight to max out pretty much everything, as of this writing.",4,1
230,Sarah Stamper,"I do enjoy playing this game, however the Quests are annoying and repetitive. I'm tired of leveling up my little fisherman penguin and would love to see other penguins in the quests. It also needs more things to do with gems, maybe in game buffs? Exclusive creatures to buy that help aside from the ones in the chests? Its fun but it's just feels like it's only a portion of a game",3,1
231,LeeNTien aka Teru,"Sadly pointless. Endless waiting game. Throw money at it or wait for months to see a larger ""penguin town "" on your screen.",2,0
232,Jesus Rore,"I think it's the best game I've ever played, with time you get to realize about some techniques to progress more and that's absolutely amazing. I'm here once more just to make some small suggestions that I'd love to see: Better distribution of penguins around the island not just staying in the middle, more visual improvements when upgrading habitats, another way to increase heart production and, finally, be able to connect with Facebook. Nevertheless, still being an amazing game. <3",5,1
233,Sephy The Great,"I love this game. It is beyond adorable with all the creatures having little animations. It has a very rewarding system from giving you gift boxes during active play to their quest and researching mechanics. By far, my favorite idle game. Though, I do wonder how much money they must make. I actively want to watch ads for the rewards. That and the in-app purchases must bring in a small countries with of income. I'd recommend (and have recommended) giving this game a try!",5,1
234,creative name,"amazing game ; it helps with my depression and anxiety by calming me down, the music is relaxing and the graphics are perfect for a game like this - but, i hate ad placements, when i get the boxes(?) they're annoying, i don't know if i can remove them at all because im new, and i hate cluttered spaces so it's very annoying seeing them, and i have to watch the ads or else they'll stay there and clutter up. and the ads disturb the gameplay and ruin it for me - otherwise, it's awesome",4,1
235,tiBUOY _,"This game is perfect for spending some time and relaxing, the art design is so nice and the ambience is great. I only have one problem though, the controls still need some tweaking. Moving around your island and scrolling through the page to upgrade things is not smooth and feels unpolished. This kinda gets annoying overtime and hard to deal with. Overall this game is very nice and with a little more tweaking I'd give it 5 stars.",4,1
236,James Walter,Good time killer and I definitely approve of the new updates. I'm thoroughly shocked though that the development gap before the whales nest is still so huge. It felt like I was making good steady progress only to be stopped by needing to make an extra 5-6 tiers of gold income 😑. I've already got every penguin available for me to get and it's gonna take me another couple months just to unlock the whales nest. Who knows how long to unlock the new places that came with the update.,4,1
237,Livia Way,"The graphics are just the cutest, this game always makes me smile. I do wish there were less reliance on ads, this definitely makes the game less relaxing. I'd love it a lot more if you could get coins by solving some sort of puzzle instead!! EDIT: With the updates there is less reliance on ads and a mini-game! If I could give this app more than 5 stars I definitely would!",5,1
238,Tiffanie Fix,Definitely a game you don't get bored of and its it's really relaxing to play. I love the animation behind this it's really cute. The way gifts and gems are set up unlike most games makes it achievable to buy stuff without paying money. I would like to add I have an interest in using this type of interactive games with augmented reality for hololens development it has potential,5,1
239,Shannon Sproles,"Pleasing, it's just impossible to avoid ads, and that's super frustrating. Also, the limit on how much gold and hearts you can get while idle is crazy, since you need such a large amount of both to accomplish most tasks. It's very difficult to progress without spending money, which I refuse to do. In the end, it's rather disappointing. Still pretty, though.",4,1
240,Genevieve Matlovsky,"I originally got this game to compete with my boyfriend on who could get ahead faster. At first thought it was gonna be boring and be nothing new from other apps. I WAS EXTREMELY WRONG! This game is so addicting, my boyfriend and I cant simply put it down. One thing is I wish the ads showed a little less. There the one thing that make tough. But otherwise, love everything about it!!!!!!💕💕💕such a fan. 10000000/10.",5,1
241,josh betetta,"There was update or something, idk, but it keeps closing out the game. It's been like this for weeks now and I can't play it anymore. Edit #1: I uninstalled and reinstalled and now I have access to my time away rewards but the game closes out on on me after about 20 seconds or so. Im not able to watch the ads for get the rewards. Game literally closes out on it's own",1,0
242,Bwandee Triberry,"It's like an idle game (3 stars), except it has penguins (cute, +1)and it takes way too long to level up (-1) and you need hearts for one level up and money for a different level up. But it's impossible to get hearts without producing a lot of money...and you'll never be able to produce that much money (1 star) but the penguins do decorate with flowers (ugh...2 stars)",2,0
243,Fluffystuff 500,"This app is very cute and fun for a while, but after a few upgrades to my island, my phone started lagging and getting really hot while playing. I had to uninstall because I wasn't sure my phone could handle it anymore. So as a warning, be careful. If your phone/tablet is multiple years old, like mine, it might not be able to run the game.",3,1
244,Tori w,"Overall I enjoy the game. I really miss the whale though, it was a beautiful animation unlike the treasure ship that just doesn't fit the same ""feel"" that the rest of the game does. It's just awkward, bland and unattractive.Also it's been taking me FOREVER to get past am coins after almost a month of upgrades I just made it to ap and I still have to get to aq for my next location to be unlocked. The slow progression has made me play less same with collecting 550 hearts for research.",4,1
245,Catherine Deng,"To be honest, I've always hated these tycoon games because it was so boring and they were like cookie clicker games. But, this game is not like the others. The photo feature is really nice and the penguins are cute. The island that this game takes place on is aesthetically pleasing. I love how the penguins interact with each place differently and sometimes even take decorations and put them in the middle of the island. The music also enhances the calming experience. 10/10 would recommend.",5,1
246,Kat Valentine,"The game is maybe fun, but you will be very limited if you don't want to watch ads. Normally I just spend a few bucks to get rid of ads in a game like this, but they want $30 *per month*!! You can buy many AAA PC and console games for $30 one time and they will never show you any ads. Major MMO games with monthly fees cost less than that and will show no ads. Whoever set that pricing scheme is downright delusional. Change it to $5 one time and I'll consider playing this. Ridiculous.",2,0
247,Steve Steffen,"Not at all what I was expecting, very peaceful and adorable IDLE game. Was told it's a clicker and it definitely is not. Had to turn off sound fx cause some of the game sounds are CRAZY unequal and hurt my ears. Also please fix the sliding on menus it's super frustrating when you're trying to scroll and it's just not catching at all. Otherwise this was alot of fun and I hope the devs are happy with this adorable iceberg family.",4,1
248,Samuel Chandler,"Cool art design very peaceful, however it is impossible to complete all quests without spending money, namely the ad skip tickets that can only be obtained through real world purchase. Note that one will never be able to continue fulfilling quests until they have purchased these tickets. Perhaps adding a different method to obtain these tickets would work...",3,1
249,Moni Schu,"Great free game!!! Graphics are fantastic! I love using the camera and following around the different little penguins and critters. While the goal is to expand, you don't feel rushed (it will come in time). Love the holiday and themed events! This game is a ""keeper"" for me! ♡ OH... and the music is nice and yeah there are ads but it's a free game and the developers need to earn $ somehow and it's worth dealing with a few ads. No biggie.",5,1
250,Let's Change,"I really love this game, it's really fun to see my island expand. However, I think the amount of ads you have to watch to progress really makes it hard to enjoy. I've found myself watching ad over ad just to progress in the game on a basic level and it's tiring. I think it would be great if ads were placed only in the store, to open a chest and get free gems and not in the whale summoning and gift boxes. Anyways other than that, love the game!",3,1
251,NoddyGirl,"Adorable game! Downloaded on a whim and I'm happy I did. Such a beautiful atmosphere and lovely calming music. It's not a pay to win game and there is no push to to buy diamonds. They are very generous with the amount of diamonds and gold you constantly get. Yes, you can chose to watch ads for more rewards but you dont have to. Lovely game! Definitely a 5 out of 5 ❤🐧 Thank you. Ps. Reading some of these other reviews is a bit baffling. Are you people even commenting on the correct game?! 😏",5,1
252,Nathen Detweiler,The game is awesome as a time killer. Ive played as someone who wouldn't spend money and also as someone who does and they are pretty equal in the sense the game doesnt seem designed to force you to spend money. That by itself is amazing. My only complaint is your penguins will stay in one spot even if you have all that open space.,4,1
253,Chris Harrison,"One of the most ad heavy games I've ever come across. It's artistically well done, but mechanically, the number of ads you have to watch to accomplish anything is ridiculous. If you actually want an ad free experience, you'll need to subscribe for $30/month. That boggles my mind. It seems there's this company that buys games from design studios, and then shotgun blasts their advertising throughout.",2,0
254,Erik Engberson,"Excellent progression until you try to obtain the Whale's Nest. Up to that point, the growth of your penguin habitat is really quite smooth and enjoyable. The game flowed at a decent pace (almost perfect, tbh), until the Hot Air Balloon Ride was purchased through naturally occurring in-game currency. After that, prepare to spend a solid MONTH just trying to get any further. The Whale's Nest is gapped so far apart that you run out of any boosters like being able to place more penguins.",3,1
255,Jonathan Foster,"The game is relaxing, however not very engaging, especially once you get past the hot air balloon upgrade, when the game severely slows down. At that point you can expect to check the game a fifth of the tkme you were before just waiting for currency to build up again. Needs more engagement or a nerf to the required currency. Currently sitting at (ao) gold and already upgraded all my penguins and still need to get to at least (aq) for the whales? Thats boring. Also needs more penguin facts.",4,1
256,Mark Swinimer,"On the surface, it's a relaxing and aesthetically pleasing clicker type game. In my first 20 minutes I found that ads were nearly mandatory to watch, as they rewarded exponentially more resources than waiting. Upon looking for an ad free option, I discovered they monetized the heck out of this game. There was no ad free option, but there were 'ad skip tickets' which you could buy an amount of with real money. Terrible monetization, do not encourage this please.",1,0
257,Matt Harris,"Fun for a couple of days, but dies off quickly as it takes longer and longer to buy upgrades. Also got really slow and stuttery on PIxel 3a XL after about a week. Too much reliance on ads. If you're aren't watching 20+ mins of ads a day with this app you'll never get anywhere. The UI is well done, the game just gets old quick. *Open, watch ads to get boxes, close because I can't afford any upgrades*",2,0
258,Dragoro,"This game is extraordinarily relaxing. Except for having to watch some ads to pass some challenges, this is peaceful and relaxing. I uninstalled because after I had gotten the app, my battery would rapidly die during the night. Dont know if its correlated, but the issue seemed to subside when I uninstalled. Will try again later to see if it was just me",4,1
259,Michael Mirza,"Succeeds at what it aims to be. Lovely music and visuals; very peaceful and fun to upgrade. I docked one star because while there's a robust set of creatures and settings you can earn, actual interactivity with your penguins is minimal. Let me tap them and get a reaction, or give them a toy, or something. I want to feel more like I have a relationship with then rather than am just watching them. This is fundamentally a game about upgrading your island by watching ads. And it's very good at that!",4,1
260,King Jones,This game rocks. Very simple. Nice healing music and the sound of the waves is just amazing. Not to mention the island is fully 360 degree viewable. I love the concept. Kinda makes you fall in love with penguins a bit. I can tell this is going to be my next favorite game. There is something special about this game i cant quiet pin point but none the less. Awesome job creators. Id definitely spend money on this. 5 Stars,5,1
261,Jeremy Sotomayor,"Very time consuming and annoying once you get a little ways in. The game starts to be repetitive and there is nothing more but taking pictures, tapping birds, watching ads, and waiting 10 minutes at a time for you're coins to generate. Was fun in the beginning but at the until it forces you to watch ads or else you'll spend hours waiting on the coins. I'm not a big fan of making a bunch of in app purchases either, it's not like the game is multiplayer or on console.",3,1
262,Chris Fairbanks,"Asks for Google permissions it has no need for (personal info) which is a real security concern regardless of whether the developer claims they aren't using the data for anything. It's still inappropriate, and a serious problem with installing this app. Game play is a lot of fun, although after about a month, it started taking way too long to get anywhere near the next level up, so I uninstalled the game. It is also a bit of a bandwidth and battery hog, with a lot of animation and ad loading.",3,1
263,一❶❹,"I saw a ad from another game and I was thinking, oh..Another borjng ad..But this game really caught my eyes, and I was like wow..Who's the creator of this game? The graphics are beautiful, the color decisions are absolutely perfect! And it's a very soft and peaceful game! This game can make my self feel calm completely..You can even skip ads! Now that's what I call a good game! Wow. And I think the events that you're making are cool, thank you for creating this game, this game beats all others🐧",5,1
264,Pat Dayton,"Despite the awesome animation of the characters, this game is still full of bugs for syncing. I regularly lose hours of off-time gameplay due to issues with the game syncing with my Google account. The latest update says they have fixed the bug, but it hasn't. Unless it was Apple-specific, I am experiencing issues. I am using a Pixel 3. If there is a platform available where I can report issues, I'd love to provide feedback. Until that is available, I don't know what to do.",2,0
265,Jamee Breanna Fleming,"I played this game every single day for months it is very fun and unique, one of my favorites for sure. I've gotten to the point where a 12 hour time token will only allow me to upgrade 5 or 6 things.. I'm stuck in a hole and am not progressing at all.. It takes a few minutes for videos to even load to get my offline earnings or any other gift box.. wish there were always daily incentives as well. I guess it was fun while it lasted I keep hoping an update will fix it but to no avail. 😩",3,1
266,Claire Bennett,This game is AMAZING!! I love it! The only ads you get are the ones you chose for a prize. You can easily gain a lot of money 💰 lts not difficult but it's definitely not easy. Its just a fun mindless game that kinda calms you when you play it. You should get this game even if you don't like penguins. They have other animals too! Def recommend!!,5,1
267,Barb,"Adorable game. Super relaxing. I love that I'm not constantly being asked to rate or buy anything. I don't mind watching a few ads to progress. A lot of apps pressure users to buy something, it's just an option in this one, and I appreciate that. Best app I've ever found on Instagram. uwu",5,1
268,Nathaniel Rodriguez,"I started playing this game back when there was almost nothing to it but collecting penguins but it still had it's own charm. The decoration and crafting system were very welcome additions. But this summer event, charging $10 for a pass is ridiculous. Past events you could get all the items for free or at least use gems that could be paid for or earned if you didn't have the time. Please add a way to earn the pass or make it purchasable with gems. I don't want to give up on this game.",2,0
269,Sydney Teagarden,"I never write reviews for apps EVER. However, I've raved about this game too much to my friends to keep silent! The devs knocked this game out of the park. I usually hate idle games that force you to hoard resources or don't give you the ability to progress quickly without buying currency. However, the constant availability of optional ads (and NO popups) and rewards for like every single milestone means that I feel in control of the speed at which I was upgrading. + Offline rewards? APPRECIATE",5,1
270,Hunter Foster,"Favorite game by far, it's so fun and super easy to play with a 1 yrs old running around. Im gonna miss the whale rewards though I hope you replace with something just as fun and easy to get bonus coins. Definitely wish you could acquire more penguins than you allow. And Itd be cool to see the penguins do more than just stand in huddled groups. Like playing around.",3,1
271,Sariah McCarrey,"I actually really really liked this game until the most recent update. Now it crashes every single time within a minute of opening. I do not get any hourglass rewards for when I've been gone, which is frustrating, and it won't pull up any ads for me to watch to earn things. And it crashes every single time I open it. Without fail. I hope they can fix it because I really do like this app!",1,0
272,Desirrae Wells,"Whereas I really love everything about this game ( the in app features and look of it all ) I have come across what I would consider a huge issue and that would be that my offline time doesn't always matter, the hour glass doesn't always show up whether I've been away for 5 minutes or 5 hours so I'm not able to collect the coins/hearts I otherwise should be able to collect. Quite the bug, honestly.",3,1
273,Isaac Vidal,"I love the game, it's really simple but calming and artistic. Although the game is a plus for me id like to give some ideas that could be enjoyable. I think adding a prestige system and new places to buy could be a good idea. The prestige system can give you bonus hearts and gold when you prestige. This is obvious but more things to buy such as the penguins and penguin jobs. Other than that keep up the good work.",5,1
274,Makunt Izichi,"Such a simple, easy, fun game to play. The graphics and sounds and music are so aesthetically pleasing, the gameplay is simple and not so complicated like the other tycoon games. Everything about this game is so therapeutic and beautiful. I absolutely love playing it, the penguins are so adorable and you really can de stress with this gorgeous game. Well done guys.",5,1
275,Cara Miller,"This game is so good. I like building a penguin world, and the music is calming. I play this as an idle app, so I don't mind waiting to get more coins. I'm at bh now. The only thing I don't like is that the ratio of collecting penguin hearts is SO different, and I can't boost it up. It will take forever to collect hearts that I need. Edit* they listened and the update is amazing! I can earn more hearts now!",5,1
276,Olivia Moore,"A game hasn't captivated my attention like this in a long time. I actually love how long it takes to gain coins and hearts. The ads, while longer (30 sec), aren't overly intrusive. If you're looking for a game to score big quick and ""beat"", this is not for you. It's a slow, wonderful burn that can absolutely be enjoyed without spending a single dime! At this point, I would pay to remove ads and stick with time based recharge, but $30/month isn't in the cards just to save a bit of time.",5,1
277,SayderCascading,"The game is relaxing, but there are a lot of microtransactions and even more ads. Normally I don't mind a few ads, but the developers have allowed political ads and I find that unacceptable. You can't collect everything (especially for events) without spending money. EDIT: Down to one star, app crashes every time I try to open it and interact with anything (including playing any ads) so can't even play, going to uninstall.",1,0
278,Wendy Wang,"It's great for the most part. The penguins are cute, and the music is very nice. However, if you already purchased multiple LE big packs in the store, you should be able to skip the ads and get the rewards right away. This game also makes my phone super hot. I'm using a pixel 2 so it's not a phone with super low specs. I still love it despite the flaws.",4,1
279,Amber Johnson,"I play many tycoon games, but there is something about this one that I genuinely LOVE! Not only is the game relaxing and very cute, but I enjoy that it's easy to progress through - it doesn't feel like it takes a million years to advance after a certain point. The only downside I have is the long advertisements. I have no problem supporting the game by watching ads, however with the whale summoning it would be nice to have a choice on watching one or spending some in game currency.",5,1
280,Shylynn Wolfgang,"I LOVE this game. There's no energy or anything so you can literally play for hours. Its calm and relaxed and just beautiful. You can purchase things, but it's definitely not a requirement like most games. There's also no pop-up annoying ads. Only thing I DONT like is the penguins like to hangout with the same species, there will be like 10 Macaroni penguins hanging out together. But all the species do it. Also, they tend to stay on the main island so there will only be a few on the other island",5,1
281,Lisa McDonald,"So this is a revised review. Since my last review, alot of exciting things have happened! A lot more penguins, a lot more interaction. I absolutely love this game! I look forward to every new penguin. So cute! I do wish that we could put out more decorations, i have to store decorations to put out new ones. I love the events, gives me something to shoot for. Every update brings something fun and cool. New penguins and deco. Thank developers for stepping up!!",5,1
282,leaffytoothpaste,"My first days playing this game was great... Until it started bugging out :/ Even when I complete a few of the quests, it doesn't register as having completed. I can't watch ads anymore either. Besides that, I love the design and it really is calming. The penguins are adorable. Love the music. Due to the bugs, I feel like I am stuck where I am at, and the game feels pointless. I hope the bugs will be fixed so I don't have to uninstall this entertaining game :/",3,1
283,Katie Bastian,"My kids really love this app, however for an ""Everyone"" appropriate app. There is a ""Teen"" add that pops up called Brainwash about about xray vision, it demonstrates seeing through peoples clothes. My son was like oh no what was that?! I don't know if you have any control over your adds, but if it can be removed I would definitely update my review",2,0
284,Travis Hibbs,"I love this app, but it's time to say farewell. The reason is kinda funny. I want Audrey. I'd totally buy Audrey for $2 or $3, but unfortunately she's part of a $15 bundle that includes things I'm not interested in, so I'm quitting to keep the whale within me from going too far. Thank you to the developers, I recommend this app wholeheartedly to anyone who wants a cute little stress reliever in their day.",4,1
285,Crystal Clubb,"Update: it's doing it again... Edit: I'm enjoying the game once again now that things are working correctly. I've lost lots of currency due to the hour glass not being on the screen. I thought it was fixed right after the update but it's still not showing the boat/whale, hour glass, or gift boxes. It's infuriating because if no currency is gained while away, upgrading is impossible.",1,0
286,John Hewitt,"Really well made idle clicker. Solid graphics, good sound. It's very stable overall. All in all a fun game to pick up and play. Lots of little surprises. It gives you a lot of freedom in doing upgrades. The photo system is a nice touch. The overall sense of progression is visible as you get more penguins, upgrades and new creatures. 5/5 for creative penguin design alone.",5,1
287,Christopher Gil,"It's such a beautiful game! One main reason this attracted me to download it because I love penguins haha. But graphics are great and so relaxing. And to progress is really reasonable. Not too slow. And ads I don't mind at all because you guys don't let it pop up randomly which is the way every game should be. And if I want to get extra stuff, I will watch the ad. One tiny suggestion is to add the actual penguins real sound each one specifically. And mini games! Wish I can say more! Great game!",5,1
288,Jenny Gould,"Like this game overall, but I end up watching a ton of ads so I can't quite categorize it as relaxing as it claims. Needs to be changed so you can decorate the place without the limit. I have a ton of stuff I've crafted but I can't put it anywhere! Why? Please change this! I want to make my isle awesome but it's barren in so many places. at this point in the game there's literally nothing else to do cuz I'm just waiting to level up and watching ad after ad. Also- 45 sec.ads are wayyy to long",3,1
289,Chris Sommers,"Overall can't recommend. Getting any meaningful progress requires watching a ton of long ads. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game. The upshot is there are no forced random ads. You choose to watch them for various ""bonuses,"" which are pretty much required to progress. But if you want to just watch penguins have fun, good luck because the app is poorly optimized and drains the battery faster than any other app I've used. My wireless charger can't even keep up.",2,0
290,First Last,"I would write my experience, if I could play the game. After the games done loading in it just freezes on the screen with penguin standing on the corner of the iceberg. It gets done loading and then the penguin starts the move but then he just freezes. The music is still playing in the background though. I tried clicking, dragging and zooming in on the screen but it's not doin anything. If this problem is fixed Ill reinstall it.",3,1
291,Wyatt N,"This game does ADs the best way possible. Unfortunately ADs are now normal in a game and the worst kind is forced or unrewarded, not with this game! I am voluntarily clicking on them because they're short, I get a sweet reward for watching, as well as a bigger reward for watching a certain amount. The game is nice and a calming idle game with detail put into it. From the camera option with zoom and water effects to the multiple different penguins and reward system that seems to never quit.",5,1
292,Zue Zue,"its pretty fun and seems great for most ages, it would be bice to have a some shorter ads if possible since it seems like you need to watch them alot, which i understand, especially for a free time based game, especially for upgrades, and maybe a lil fact about each type of penguin as you upgrade them to certain lvls, once i get farther in, ill give more details and opinions in better accuracy, but overall seems interesting at the moment, thanks. ^w^",4,1
293,Ray Lux,"This game is wierdly enjoyable. All you do is slowly build up an island full of funny little penguins. There's a ton of different kind of penguins and animals you can get. It's definitely a slow pace but that's the point. You can check in every day and make a bunch of upgrades and every day your island grows. There are a couple annoying things though, often to get rewards it will make you watch an ad. This is optional of course but you'll be watching a lot of the same stupid mobile ads.",3,1
294,Jessica Imperial,"I loved this game, it's so cute and funny. But a recent update made the game unplayable. It crashes right after being opened. Finally after multiple weeks of crashes with no news the game had a new update today (hooray they fixed it) except it wasn't a fix, it is the Christmas event... Which I can't participate in because the game will only stay open for seconds at a time 😭. Oh well, guess I'll have to play something else.",1,0
295,Hailey Thurston,"I NEVER chose to rate apps unless I have something to complain about. This is the first exception. This game is incredibly calming, and not based in ads either. Ads are optional and can be watched for quick progress, but progress is steady through the game regardless. It's the first farming game that doesn't force you to pay or watch ads in order to progress. I love it so much as it really helps me calm my anxiety. It reminds me of animal crossing in the way it relaxes me.",5,1
296,Stephanie St. Germain,"While it is a fun and cute time waster, it crashes far too often resulting in not getti g rewards for unlocking areas or opening chests. It freezes often when any prompt boxes come up for taking a picture, rewards, and to upgrade. The ads are also annoying when they're required to progress quests. The speed of game play plateaus super bad and the rest of the game even with ads is beyond grindy.",2,0
297,Ice Poseidon,The game is very beautiful and peaceful. The tasks and achievements are amazingly integrated into helping you progress. The one flaw is the need to watch ads to progress. I personally dont mind this but you need to watch ads for some achievements. It is extremely hard ot progress unless you watch ads. Another flaw is that theresnid nothing to do s lot of the time. I wish there was a minigame you could play with your penguins. Other than that. The game is fun especially if you like to grind.,4,1
298,Delilah Byrd,"Love it! Such a calming little game to play when youre bored or stressed out. Even if you close the game it will automatically save everything you did, and i love that you can customize the village with decorations! You dont need to have wifi to play, and you can still do everything you could normally do. One thing id like to see improved is the way you scroll through things. Its little laggy, and only scrolls after youve let go. The layout and graphics could be better, but overall a great game",4,1
299,7,"I play this game with my SO. My job requires a lot of paperwork, so I just leave the game open and let it run through a few commercials while I work. At the end of the day, before bed, we spend all the earnings and talk about how adorable each new animal is. Fantastic game for anyone who enjoys adorable little animals.",5,1
300,KingOfMC owo,"I just LOVE the app. All I know is that when I am upset, I will definitely go on this app. One feature I love is the backround music. It is so calming. I also love the animation for the treasure/pirate ship! (Great Job😀👍) Just the idea if making and island or glacier(forgot which) for penguins is great! I also like the idea of the ABC's at the end of my currency so I can understand where exactly how much I have. Overall, I would recommend this calming, peaceful and amazing game to my friends.",5,1
301,Jacey Newman,"This is my all-time favorite game. I've been playing it now for a full month and I love it so much. It entertains me a lot atleast. Sure, it has some ads, but atleast they aren't random ad's that just pop up, these ads are optional and you can watch them for rewards for your penguins. And I usually always do cause the 30 seconds of ads are worth it to me 😂 I'm weird though. My only one complaint is that is does make my phone extremely hot and drains the battery. But still worth it.",5,1
302,Hailey Stark,"The new update messed up the game. The ad rewards no longer work. They glitch out every time and I never get the reward for it. Especially with my offline one, it never gives me the reward and I can no longer watch ads for some reason to double it. Hasnt work since the new update but it ran fine before hand. I like the game and it can be a little challenge but still relaxing which is great. It has a wonderful balance between the two. I love all the penguins in the outfits! It's super cute.",4,1
303,Howard Low,"The game is pretty relaxing and nice to play. For a good amount of time, it gives you the satisfaction of levelling up the penguin. I have to give it a 3 a star because it forces you to watch through the FULL ads and there is no mechanics nor options to disable it, even if I'm willing to pay. I've watched more ads in a day on my mobile phone then my entire mobile life. Every time you resume the game, you have to watch THREE FULL UNSKIPPABLE ADS. The negativity makes the game painful",3,1
304,c James,"Everything about this game is amazing, especially the penguins & the graphics. However the end game currency management is messed up. The developers say they are fine tuning it but in the meantime they're happy to take your money for a game I question if you can actually finish. It doesn't take an advanced math degree to know when challenges get progressively more difficult or expensive while the % change in payouts is nowhere close to keeping pace, the game is going to stall out.",2,0
305,Genesis Sales,"I love this game but I have reached a hiatus and don't have much to do anymore. I'm at my last property to buy which is the Theater but I have already reached tier 20 of research and no more quests to complete. It is very hard to accrue coins to buy the last property without having quests and offline rewards aren't enough. Unfortunately, besides the love and compassion that I have acquired over the last few months of playing this game, I have to give it a rating of 4 stars.",4,1
306,Gay Knauf,"Hey habby, Thanks for removing so much lag and literally allowing us to have fun decorations, but. the limit is dumb, 30 is a bad amount, just make it where we dont have a limit, and maybe just not double prices once you buy a new island part, i have gotten to the aa part and the deer rance is just way to much, its gonna take me a long time. But still, keep up the good work habby.",5,1
307,Ibel Thorns,I love the way this game is set up. It keeps me coming back to see how my penguins are doing. I love the way you implement gems and the other forms of cash and that you can actually get gems quite easily with ads and tasks. I just absolutely love what you've done with the animations as well. They're all so cute and creative. I would have never expected a balloon popping at the adventure park or a cotton candy maker penguin. This is one of the best relaxing games I've ever played.,5,1
308,Gordatados,"Cute little game where you watch your penguins make money. Can even make some creatures that walk around with them. Nice and relaxing to watch. My only complaint is that there's not much of anything to DO. Maybe you could make a mini game for each habitat and use the penguins and creatures hatched to play in each mini game? Maybe you could win hearts or money or something. But all in all, I like this game. 👍 (And the event is up and working too.)",4,1
309,Oliver,"This game seems like it could be really great and fun, but unfortunately there are a few problems that make it quite annoying to play. The main issue is offline progress not working. 90% of the time my offline progress chest never shows up. Aside from that, the number of ads you have to watch to make any meaningful progress is painful. Half the time the ads don't even load, and when they do load they don't always give you the reward. Not unplayable in its current state, but it's annoying to play",2,0
310,kev john,"Entertaining and soothing, it offers a much-needed break from all the zombie and human killing that i do in the other games that i play. Absolutely free to play! There are a lot of ads though, and they can sometimes be repetitive (showing the same ad numerous times in a row), but it's not even close to being a deal-breaker for me. Some of the Quests can take awhile to complete (i.e. collecting penguin hearts) but the pace of the game allows you to progress slowly but surely.",4,1
311,corry hodgkin,The game is a blast. It's adorable and cute and easy. Grinding doesn't seem like a chore. The reason why I'm giving it the stars is because on more than one occasion I will load into the game and not receive the money I have earned offline. Please fix. This time alone I missed out on 4.5n gold...,3,1
312,Zakk Mullenix,"The game is a very good way to pass time if you're waiting for something, or you're bored. You'll always be greeted by the penguins (who are incredibly adorable) you can open chests, and get little cards to make special penguins, and they make me laugh to myself. Overall, I highly recommend getting the game! (Especially if you love penguins like me!)",5,1
313,Abby M,"I really love playing this game and hope they add more mini/arcade games in the future. There are too many adds, not on the main screen but to earn necessary items, and it can get tedious. It also takes way too long to earn hearts and I think there needs to be more ways to accelerate hearts. I'd like to see more penguins available and increased decorating space added as you grow your island.",4,1
314,Cody Stone,"The game was a lot of fun while I was still making progress not it's unbearably slow. I need 8.61 ar to unlock whale island and I'm only making about 500 an per second, with all penguins and stats maxed. At this rate I'll but stuck here forever. I haven't complained a bit up until now, the game has been a consistent grind but now its plateaued and I think the income needs some tweaking once you've progressed this far.",2,0
315,shutterbird 13,I upgraded my rating from one star to four because the game finally started working...and I really like it. The penguins are adorable and the rewards system is fairly plentiful. I've unlocked all but the last habitat. The only complaint I have is that the play is a little uneven. You're either earning money and hearts hand over fist and unlocking and creating left and right or you're stuck doing next to nothing but watching ads for a week straight. But it's charming.,4,1
316,Kimosabi H,"It's a fun game. The only issue that I have since the latest update is when I try to watch any video for another reward, the videos never open. I end up restarting the game, I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app with no luck. I really like the additional penguins and holiday decorations but I wish more could be displayed at a time. Also, my quest list is failing to update with new quests and I can't pay. 1 heart either, they both day updating check back later.",4,1
317,Jayme Ayn,I really love this game. It is soothing to play. Nothing that requires much thought. I took a 2 stars off because: 1. How long it takes helper penguin to remove something. 2. How limited space there is for decorating. Why have so many decorations options if so limited. I would love to decorate more but can't. 3. How long it takes to make something. I will keep playing because I love penguin's ha. Just wish wasn't limited on decoration placements.,3,1
318,Courtney Papa,"This game is excellent and a great way to relax. I would 110% recommend this game. It's simple to play, great background noise, and just overall a great game. There's ads but you're not required to watch them for every other move you make and I think it's awesome. I actually play the ads everytime the option comes along simply because it's my choice whether or not I do. Download this game, you wont regret it",5,1
319,Tiffany James,Fun but there seems to be a glitch. Every time I try to tap the screen to correct hearts or do something it moves. The island will go in the far distance and I have to scroll the screen to find the island again. Then if I tap the screen anymore it happens again. This makes it hard to collect items and play. Please fix this I would hate to have to delete the app stove when it works is actually fun. Samsung galaxy tab A,3,1
320,Avi Keating,"Overall, I love the aesthetics and I'm very excited to progress and grow my island, along with adding more penguins to my roster! But whenever I try to watch an ad for Pirate Ship Summoning and whatnot the game crashes. I wouldn't be annoyed if it didn't inhibit my gameplay, but a lot of the daily challenges revolve around being able to watch the ads, and it's making me unmotivated to actually bother playing the game, despite how much I've been enjoying it so far.",3,1
321,James Lupei,"I like everything about the game, raising penguin and watching them do their thing, but it has one big flaw: The quests. Complete 12 photo missions, summon ship 7 times, open 16 treasure boxes, collect 660 hearts, and they get worse. It's boring having to do these over and over again. You'd have to play for hours a day otherwise the research progress will be too far behind. Eventually I decided to quit. By itself it's a good game though, if you have the time for it.",3,1
322,Aes Velocity,"This game helps calm me down when I'm stressed or upset with the music and how easy everything is. My only complaint is how many times you have to watch ads to get rewards it's just annoying. :/ The music in the ads are usually annoying and I normally have my volume all the way up since the music is calming. I'm also not a fan of how long it takes to craft things. Like bro it takes 2 hours just to craft one thing! I'd say mabye 10 minutes is the limit. Anyways a super good game, and I love it!",5,1
323,Adam,"""Relaxing"" game? Sure... If you don't want any of the free gifts that pop up in the water. Otherwise you're hit with a 30 second ad immediately followed by a 15-20 second ad of the same thing. You literally can't progress without those gifts in the water. The ads are so long, it gives me 1-2mins of offline time for every ad that plays. How pathetic is that??",1,0
324,Sai Lakkimsetty,"This isn't a game in any traditional sense. This app is very inefficient as it drains a lot of battery. Edit: Thanks for your reply. I do have a suggestion. I think the game elements are rendered while they are offscreen as well; I don't know this for sure since this isn't open source, but just a hunch. That could be the reason why it's compute intense. Perhaps a better approach would be to just render elememts that are on-screen/ from camera first perspective.",2,0
325,MaxiMumSavageYT,"Been playing for 2-3 months now and the game a really great slow grinding! Super great graphics and all the animals are really lively, I have seen all the animals get stuck running in the same direction so I hope the AI does get an upgrade! Lots a people expect much from games like this but in general it's an ""idle"" game so like I said slow grinding unless you pay your way in",5,1
326,Dana Stribling,"2 weeks ago, I would have given this game 5 stars. It was easy to play, did involve some grinding, but you could still progress at a decent pace without spending money or HOURS on the game. But recently, that us not the case. I feel like I have been stuck in the same ""level"" for ages and my rate of money no longer really increases and it's just frustrating.",2,0
327,Hannah Werner,"I adore this game. I am glad they added the feature where your penguin can remove decorations on order to give you more space to fill in your own. My island is looking wonderful, although I am not sure if storing normal penguins will affect the gold and heart benefits that they offer... I want to make more space for the penguins to walk around. Other than that, the game is super cute and is a great way to idly spend time.",4,1
328,Haylee A,"I absolutely loved this game, super relaxing and cute. And then randomly one day it stopped opening completely. I tried updating it to no avail, even reached out to the developers and no response. I don't want to uninstall it and reinstall again because I've already invested a lot of time into this game and was almost to the end. Leaving this review in hopes that the developers will at least respond to this. Edit: they totally helped me figure it out, definitely recommend.",5,1
329,Laura Logan,"This game ruined my life. I had a talking to at work for missing meetings. My friends couldn't have a casual conversation with me without it turning into an argument that I ""Wasn't listening"" or ""We had this conversation yesterday, don't you remember it?"" or ""No, your penguins are not as important as my kid."" I spent over 25$ on gems and I'm living month to month as it is. I thought ""Oh, once I get to Z I'll shower."" Cut to AH and my head is itchy. Anyway, I had to uninstall it. Great game.",5,1
330,Brent Krous,"At first it's a pretty cool idle clicker. Then after you progress (not even very far), it turns into an app, where you logon a couple times a day, watch a few ads and close it. There really isn't a reason to stay on and ""click"" or do anything because eventually you're capped and it's 100% ad driven gameplay.",3,1
331,Austeja Surgailaite,"I played this game for the past two months and got all the way through the ferris wheel It's perfect for when you need something in the background. However, before you add any more content, YOU NEED TO ADDRESS RESEARCHAND CHALLENGE LEVELS. They run out prematurely, and especially without the research, it makes it impossible to get enough money for more worlds. I'll install again in a month or so if I see you've updated those things and added more worlds. Not interested in the workshop addition.",4,1
332,Jennifer Runion,"I love this game. Yes, if you want to build the higher level stuff it takes a while to amass that much gold, but to me it's supposed to be a slow and steady calming game. Collect your gold, maybe craft some decor, take a few pics of the penguins, and done. Adorable, simple, calm. Love it. Four stars only because some fun mini games or additional quests would be a great addition.",4,1
333,Elizabeth H,"The timer took longer and longer to show up as I played through the game until now it often doesn't show up. Also, if I don't have enough internet connection, the whale will tell me that and not give me any points but stay on the screen, however the gift box will disappear without giving me any points and I'll have to wait until the next time it wants to show up",3,1
334,Ben Kuiper,"I've put an unreasonable amount of time into this game for how much I hate it. I'm looking down the line and it'll be DAYS of in-game time before I can make the next permanent progression level. Once you get past the early game, the gameplay is literally just watching ads. 95% of meaningful progress is achieved through watching an ad. The game makes a pathetic attempt at contextualizing your ad watching experience (Summon a whale! Open a treasure chest!) But it really boils down to it intentionally crippling your progress until you watch literal dozens of ads to advance to the next level. Most clicker games are grinds for sure, but the best ones are about efficiency and prioritizing one advancement avenue over another. THIS one, on the other hand, is a series of arbitrary gates unlocked exclusively behind the player soullessly sitting through bite sized chunks of OTHER developers' content. Even then, there are punishing diminishing returns as playtime continues, requiring (as previously mentioned) DOZENS of viewed ads to make even an inch of perceived progress. Absolutely not worth any time.",1,0
335,Joseph Moore,Fun little game but others are right. I am at a point where it takes forever to accumulate enough money to unlock next stage. Also the number of ads that you have to watch just to make any kind of progress is stupid. I would also agree that $30 per month for no ads is criminal. I mean even Microsoft only charged $10 per year for no ads on one of its games that I play.,2,0
336,Susan,"It's a bit boring. Maybe you could add houses for penguins and maybe genders, names, and a breeding den? That way, you don't have to pay the game money for penguins? It also needs a new animation for penguins in the hot springs. How about they jump in, swim under and over water, and then swim back, jump out, and shake the water off? Also, can u plz make a forest verse plz? And in the forest verse, the trees drop acorns, the bushes grow berries, and add some seasons and weather! Thanks!",5,1
337,Blue Pit,"I really like this game. If there are any 2 issues I have with it, then they would be that when you collect a lot of the same penguin, they all crowd around where they spawned, and my other issue would be that when you advance to some of the later habitats, the old habitats pretty much stop having an effect at all.",5,1
338,Paul Nabil Matthis,"Extremely ad oriented. That covers almost all mechanics with a couple of urges to social share as well. Played it for a while then got bored of having to watch an ad to get any sort of progress. Which is a bummer, the graphics, music, and sound design are very soothing.",2,0
339,Evan Weber,"The game is a great game but there are a few problems. As soon as you get to the janitor and after, it becomes more and more difficult to make money without using gems 24/7. Another small problem that only I saw is that on the platform the janitor stands on, the broom doesn't hit the floor and neither do any penguins and it really bothers me😂. I love how cute the penguins are and I hope the devs keep updating the game to further increase the adorable experience.",4,1
340,Miranda Bogard,"Put 5 stars so everyone would see this . It's a good game , it's a good concept ... BUT it gets really irritating when almost every time I get on , the videos won't load for coins and hearts . It's super irritating , especially when I have a perfect internet signal and it STILL does it most of the time",5,1
341,Mary,"Love this game! So fun and keeps your interest; I keep coming back to it. The penguins are SO cute and I love checking on them. The graphics are amazing as well. This is my favorite app game so far! Update: I love the minigame Jump Jump, but there are a few glitches - sometimes the penguin doesn't respond to your movement accurately (it'll jump too far or won't jump at all even if you're holding down for the correct amount of time). I've lost a few rounds due to this.",5,1
342,Jeffrey,"I really love this game. The penguins are so cute, and I just love to watch them waddling around. It is also really satisfying to get new habitats and upgrade them. However, my only problem is that I sometimes have trouble collecting my offline earnings. Occasionally when I open the game, it doesn't give the pop-up that allows me to collect earnings. There have also been times where I tapped and it closed the pop-up without collecting. I would love if you could fix that.",5,1
343,Joey Russell,"Wonderful game. I love how the game looks and plays. It's not a game where you get an add every click, I love it! Penguins are the best. You can get more than penguins too! I just recently got the reindeer and he seems to get along with the penguins very well, it's like he became one of the penguin Bros. I do love my penguins! They are so cute and adorable! The music in the background is great for a relaxing evening and you just want something chill. So go get some penguins on your glacier!",5,1
344,Phoenix Shanks,"Not your average game, very relaxing and oddly hard to put down. From the cute little penguin waddles to the giant Whale splash, this game is clearly well made! Best game I've played in a while. The color pallet is very cool and calming, there was a lot of attention to detail when making this game. I really can't say how much I love this game!",5,1
345,Abdiel Aviles,"I really love this game, it's very addicting! I love the way the game looks and the way the progression system is laid out. This game does contain ads, which may seem like something that would shy people away from the game, but the way they lay out the ads is not annoying and you choose when to watch the ads, plus they reward you in game for each and every ad you watch. Developers, please please please add the ability to play this game on landscape mode! And the option to purchase ads away!",5,1
346,Sykol,"An amazing time consuming game. Entertaining, cute, and simple. I have no complaints. I saw a review that complained about how long it takes to get hearts. The game has to have some kind of difficulties to make it entertaining for players. The amount of time to gain hearts compared to coins is understandable. Totally recommend if your bored and in need of a cute, time burner.",5,1
347,Pedro Higueros,"This game is really enjoyable, and is very peaceful, relaxing and satisfying. Especially I like that someone made a game about my favorite animal the penguin of course. I suggest to add more mini games so you stay more time playing the game while the ads are loading. Finally thank for te extra help you are giving and for reading our comments.",5,1
348,Aiden Gray,"My phone ain't so bad to justify the abhorrent frame rate. On top of this, the game seems to think it's a nice, relaxing, sit and stare kinda game, but it's so not. You don't watch cute penguin doing cute penguin things, you watch a slideshow of a penguin using a fishing rod. It's... not as advertised. It might be good, I immediately uninstalled after sitting thru fifteen frames a second of a fishing hut.",1,0
349,Sydney Maison,"This game is great if you're stressed, or just looking for something cute to ease your mind. I love the buildable item interaction animations with the penguins, and watching them run about. The ads are completely optional, and you get rewards for watching them. The only suggestions I have are to make new backgrounds available for purchase with gems, a nighttime one would be much easier on the eyes before bed. Also, maybe you could implement interactions between penguins? Great game overall!!",5,1
350,Clash gaming,"Ok I can't lie this game is the best thing I have ever played, well phone games at least. There are no ads (unless you use it to get coins) and the game its self passes so much time. And not only that but it is so fun. You can decorate your island and expand it, and more. 10/10 complete recommend. Ps they didn't pay me I just love this game.",5,1
351,Logan Ferency-Viars,"Overall, good idle game. The penguins are adorable and interact with their surroundings, and the game has a great built-in snapshot feature that can freeze time to let you adjust the screen to get the perfect angle. The game does have a few points where you have to watch ads to advance levels, but it's a reasonable amount. There isn't much to do after playing continuously (watching ads) for ~15 minutes, but it's just an idle game so I'm not too concerned about that",5,1
352,Tony H,"First off, I'd like to state that I LOVE penguins. They're my favorite. That being said, if you download this game, you're going to spend 99% of your time watching ads, which isn't the issue to me. The issue is that the load time for ads is so ridiculously long, I spend more time staring at a grey box, waiting for loading, than I spend actually watching the penguins, or the ads. For reference, my highest upgraded area is level 2,035, so I play this a lot. Lowered to 1 star because of reply below",1,0
353,Rene Ibarra,"I like the game, it's a great way to spend some extra time playing, but I feel lied to. It being an idle clicker I bought the $30 ""limited"" pack in order to not have to worry about buying chests due to the ""1 card per hour."" So far I've had it for one day in total and I've gotten 5 cards from it... Is the 1 card per hour only limited for when were playing it? If so, why is not clearly stated that the ""1 card per hour"" is limited to when we are playing only.",4,1
354,James Picker,"I usually get bored quickly by incremental/clicker games, but this one has a certain charm from the pretty graphics and camera controls that many other games lack. The frequency of ads that reward you with in-game currency isn't too high to be annoying, and the world-building aspect of the game keeps progression interesting.",5,1
355,Chaotic Bread,"it's a good game, but seriously, the majority of the missions being leveling up the fishing spot 10-20 times? it's ridiculous, i'm having a hard time keeping up because it's costing so many in-game coins, why can't it be branched out between the habitats? I would like this to be fixed please",2,0
356,Chris B Ham,"I love this game. It's literally just a chill game (no pun intended) where you don't feel the need to spend money to get further in the game. As people have pointed out, there are ALOT of ads, but what they don't mention is that you don't have to watch them, but if you do, you get rewarded for it. Also the ads are only about 30s long. They have introduced an event which is pretty straightforward, the main issue was the delay due to there apple update, but there facebook explained all this.",5,1
357,Xanny Bannany,I really really like the graphics! I think you guys did really good on that. Although I think it could be more fun if the seagulls made noise when you pressed them or the other animals as well. Also I'm not super far into the the game but do the seals or penguins ever swim in the ocean? Like... not the hot springs bit the water surrounding the island? If not then I think that could be another fun addition to the game. But I really like it. It's very calming yet addictive. 10 out of 10 for sure!!,5,1
358,Mshiloh,"Cute, but stopped opening after two days. Just loads then crashes. It crashes upon saving images as well. Not sure if it's server space or just poor performance, but the only way for developers to make money off of ads is for users to actually have an opportunity to watch them, so it might be worth checking out! Super cute graphics, though. Most adorable mind numbing I've experienced.",5,1
359,Gabriel Chavez,"The game is pretty enjoyable and relaxing. The only issues are the decoration portion which limits the amount of decor you can set out. Some of the decorations even take up more slots so it's really less than originally thought. The placement of decorations is a little difficult at times but really not game breaking, eventually you can get it. Overall though, I really enjoy the game. Cannot give it 5 stars for the decoration issue but that does not make this a terrible game by any means.",4,1
360,Connor Allen,"Cute game with non intrusive ads. However, whenever I decided to watch an ad for a boost or reward the game would sit and load after the ad played but then never give me the reward. Happens every time I watch an ad. I have great wifi and a modern Google Pixel phone. It also crashed multiple times when logging in causing me to lose all of my gold I had made overnight two different times. That's losing the biggest collection two times. So I uninstalled.",2,0
361,Megan W.,"The game is cute. but eventually you hit a wall. You watch many many adds for the treasure ship, gift box, and so on to get gold to level up your iceberg. You get 20 penguins per specie. however once you get to the whale nest its over.Typically 20penguin gets you up 3 currency levels. Then suddenly its 7, it takes weeks to get that far. the island after doesn't unlock anymore penguins, it's another 7 lvls then who knows after. its to pay to play. I regret spending $.",2,0
362,kiah mattson,"I love this game! It's very calming for me and I like the achievements that are a part of it. The only thing I dislike is that you can't create an account to save your progress. If you download this app on a different device you can't log into it to keep going with how far you already were. I got a new phone and was super bummed to learn that I had to start the game all over again, even though I downloaded it on the same Google play account. If an account feature was added I would rate it 5/5",4,1
363,Dyllan Hayden,"I am having fun playing the game, but after this latest update(10/21/19 is when I downloaded the update), the nest where new penguins spawn is offset from the middle where it used to be...O don't know if it is my phone, a glitch, or a bug. Also, before the update, my letters were jumbled up and scrambled and any m, n, p, o, and e letters that were supposed to be there were not--I don't know why, but I fixed it by closing the app and waiting a couple of hours.",4,1
364,Stinky Dink,"I love this game, it's so wholesome how the penguins waddle around and just vibe and ask you to take their picture. One thing, however. I would love for there to be an update where we can name the penguins. Like give them each name tags. Because I have a Gentoo and she feels like a Dotty to me, but I can't ever tell which Gentoo is my Dotty. I would like to be able to tell my babies apart :)",5,1
365,Morgan G,I enjoy the game but it's very ad driven. I honestly would even mind the ads if the music would continuously play in the background while ads are muted. Most of the ads don't have sound anyway. Love the penguin facts ads. The music is beautiful ( but would love some variation I don't have to pay real world money for) and I fall asleep to the game most nights.,4,1
366,michelle,"Loss of progress? It seems that sometimes when I open the app, upgrades on habitats I paid for are no longer there. The rate of gold produced is lowered and the upgraded with the pink coins are no longer there (I have to pay for upgrade and use pink coins to buy these things all over again). I have the same number of penguins and diamonds as I left but my upgrades are gone. This doesn't happen every time I reopen the app, but it's happened more than once.",3,1
367,Law Trafalgar,"Its so cute. But the ""watch an ad for reward"" is annoying because its the same ad 90% of the time. Also why do i have to watch ad videos of someone who obviously cant play the game advertised. Show how the game youre advertising is played, otherwise it makes me think it's a dumb game. Love watching penguins run around though.",4,1
368,Aerofluff,"Kinda cute, but the slow gain rate means you constantly need to watch ads to have any progress at all (probably intended for that sweet ad revenue)... But it detracts from any relaxation the game might give. The slow pace + constantly feeling like I have ads on the screen (which I'm not really watching, I don't get why people pay for ads like these, it's stupid) leaves the game rather boring, and something I will probably drop.",2,0
369,KIWI,"EDIT: New mini-game is still underdeveloped; there isn't a preview to see how far you'll jump, so its based on chance and wasted gems Please lower your price for event passes. A more reasonable price would be $5. Its uneccesarily expensive for a mobile game. I expected better from this company. - Best game to unwind and relax, very good company and I appreciate all the hard work that goes into making such a cute game. Ads don't bother me with this, since I know I'm supporting these lovely people",2,0
370,Trevor Scott,"Amazing, relaxing game. The music is soothing, the gameplay is smooth, and everything is exactly how I wanted it to be. I'd say probably the most attractive aspect of this game tho, is the fact that ads are completely optional, and they are always rewarded if you watch one. They even give you bonuses for watching a set amount. Awesome game so far and I love that I can go check on my little isle anytime I'm feeling stressed.",5,1
371,Chris Miranda,"As of 11/25/2020 it's been over two weeks since the latest update on 11/9/2020 made the game unplayable. Since that update, the game crashes within 1 minute. I understand that developers are aware, and the problem seems to be mainly on Google Pixel phones. I enjoyed the game when it was working, but the developers have been very slow to fix the issue. I hope a new update comes soon.",1,0
372,Rheanna McKnight,"The game is enjoyable but for some reason no adds will load now so I can't open any of the boxes or pirate ship. I'm essentially ""stuck"" now to only be able to use everything that doesn't require an ad so I won't be receiving much in-game currency anymore. If it's not fixed soon there will no longer be a reason to play the game if I have to grind that hard to unlock a new level or get a new penguin.",1,0
373,Kelli Shook,"I've been playing this game for some time now, and all I have to say is, it's one of the best, most relaxing, and cute idle games out there, especially graphically. Most idle games are flat and 2D, which is fine, but this game just blows them out of the water. The graphics are nothing advanced, but the 3D environment and models just make it better. You are not required to buy anything to advance at a fair pace, and any extra penguins you can purchase are just for decoration. 5/5 Would recommend",5,1
374,DreamScape,"love how its basically free to play. few ads for gems. you can literally play without having to wait for hours for an upgrade. 1 issue though, fisherman is way o.p. ALL of the other penguin shops cost more to upgrade and take long to give gold and even far less gold than fisherman. my fisherman is lvl 450 ( same level as all other higher tiers) but it makes like 12k 3 secs while the highest tier igloo makes like 12j every 7-15secs. no point on unlocking new islands with this logic. needs balance",4,1
375,Scott,"Very fun game, really enjoyed the simple and beautiful look of it. As you quickly progress, you have to watch a crazy amount of 30 second ads to enjoy the bonuses which will become mandatory as a free player. Would be more enjoyable if there was a pay one time for ad free and you can collect the bonus everytime. Also as a free player you will hit the pay wall right after the hot air balloon. You could play the game for weeks to try to get the whales nest or spend lots and lots of money to get it",3,1
376,Jake Beach,"The upgrade discounts you purchase don't actually change the cost of upgrades. Hatching a new penguin also does not increase production by 150%. It increases it by a factor of 1.5, which equates to a 50% increase, not 150%. I don't think that part is done maliciously, I think English isn't the dev's first language. I also hate that every ad is a full 30 seconds. Still, the penguins are cute and it's fun to see the upgrades over time.",3,1
377,Dee Hanshew,"I love the concept, but it kept crashing and not responding, fix the bugs and I would definitely try it again.",2,0
378,Victoria Irvine,"It looks awesome & has potential, but doesn't work offline, or even when service falls below 4GLTE plus it's always freezing. I couldn't get it to work enough to see if I really liked it. Great concept though. Graphics seem quite nice, & no ads, unless it was the ads loading that freezes it. I'd love to give it more stars!",2,0
379,Radioactive Water,"I don't really like these type of games but this app is amazing. It never ever fails to calm me down no matter how angry or stressed I am. The penguins themselves are actually amazing. If you were to follow them around, you could see that they actually help you out and do tasks which I found really cute. Like I said before, amazing app if I could give more stars I would; amazing.",5,1
380,Shannon B,"Update: bug is acknowledged and being fixed. I appreciate the response! Will change to 5 stars as soon as I can play again! It's a really fun game when it works :) Previous review: Was excited to download and able to play for about 30 minutes then the game kept crashing and I lost progress. Now I can't play longer than 30 seconds, please fix!",3,1
381,Caleb Ellison,It's a good concept but the economy is terribly broken... your penguins dont earn nearly enough to progress you in the game and the only way to progress is to watch ads where your reward will be allot and I mean allot... its basically play until you have watched enough ads buy another section of land and continue... it's pretty stupid how it works you literally do nothing and it takes no effort... I played for like 30 minutes and already had several pieces of land and like level 70 penguins,2,0
382,Gene Trinks,"it's fun to look at the penguins for about 10 minutes, but if you want to really play the game you find out quickly that this is just a delivery vehicle for ads. If you try to play the game without watching ads it's so mind numbingly slow it's unplayable. Watching full 30 second ads over and over and over is the only way to move the game forward. Too bad.",2,0
383,Jake Rip,"I LOVE this game, it is so fun to watch tiny little penguins doing their penguin things. the new update is outstanding. I love how you can craft things as well as collect fish. I also love how you get random penguin facts whenever you double your offline coins. The games graphics are also really well done for a mobile game. The only complaint is that there are not enough house spots for me to feel happy with my island. There's always something I want to put in my island.",5,1
384,Hunter Hammond,"Very calming, delightful little idle game about super cute, chubby penguins! The expansion is a bit slow, without purchasing the hearts or coins you need to build rapidly, but overall a fun time waster. Wouldn't mind being able to name specific penguins, and assign them to specific jobs.. but hey, perhaps in a future update?",4,1
385,Christopher Talley,"This is a fun game. It's an ""idle"" game, which means you don't really have to do much and there's no stress involved. You don't play for points or to win... you play to grow the habitats the penguins live and play in. I find this game to be extremely entertaining. I'm in a very high level and I've paid nothing. Zero dollars. Go ahead and download this. It's completely safe and pretty dang fun.",5,1
386,Laura DuBois,"I don't review games often but this one is cool. I got addicted pretty fast. The thing I like about it is it makes the ads optional and they always give a generous payout, unlike most other games. It's easy to level up really fast which makes it more addicting. Thank you for the generous totally optional ads that don't make me want to close the game and uninstall.",5,1
387,Drew B,"I've played a lot of games like this and had fun playing. I can also understand the ads and why they are there. Most game like this have a way to pay to turn ads off, this one does too. But there is no way this game is worth $29.99 a month to turn ads off. Most games like this is a one time fee of $4.99. and to me that's good but 29.99 a month. What do you think you made a triple A game or something. World of warcraft is cheaper to play at this rate.",2,0
388,Owen P,"This game looks adorable, and I was hopeful that it would be chill and fun, but it's a horribly distracting time sink. The game isn't really the penguins or building the island. That's just a backdrop. The thing you interact with is just endless menus and ads. I felt like I barely saw the penguins, because there was always one more thing to click. One more ad to watch. One more little notification dot somewhere. Disappointing as the art style is very cute.",1,0
389,Michael Jantz,"Gameplay is enjoyable, even with ads. My only complaint is that the hearts earned don't really scale as well as the coins do. I'm stuck at like ap coins and I need to get to ar for the next island. But I am maxed out on penguins and everything and I dont make enough hearts to level up the existing islands. I need 100k and I'm only earning like 800i per heart. It's too slow, even with offline rewards. I was determined to get that whales nest but I think I will uninstall before I get there.",4,1
390,Matt Crosby,"WHAT DID YOU DO TO THIS APP? Starting about a week ago, the app hangs (progress indicator spinning forever) when watching a video. That's okay -- I can skip your ads. But now the app restarts itself every two to three minutes. Randomly. Making it completely unusable. Fix this and I'll give it five stars again.",1,0
391,Christopher Gaskins,"The game is cute, and the ad boxes are not unexpected for this kind of game. However, it quickly becomes a frustrating chore. Not every box should be a 30+ second ad. Most penguins just huddle around and do not pursue the various new places you discover. Finding the penguin with the photo option is difficult. The game runs smoothly until ""ao"" after that it is a frustrating grind. The game sucks battery life like nothing I've ever seen before.",2,0
392,J B,"Beautiful app with a lot to experience but it suffers from the same shortcomings that all of these passive apps suffer from; you get to a point where the cost to upgrade things is so high that it takes forever to earn enough, and the app becomes boring and repetitive. You can't even speed it up with purchases without spending hundreds. They need to re-level the upgrade prices to keep the app entertaining",3,1
393,Hayden Hayes,"I've been greatly enjoying this game! However it's suddenly stopped properly serving me ads, any time I try to display an ad it simply goes to a black screen, forcing me to close out the app and lose any bonus I would have gotten. I've already cleared cache and local storage but to no avail! Any help for this issue?",4,1
394,Jordan Kress,"I don't review games ever but it's about time in the year 2020 we have a great, fun, stable game that's not totally ruined with ads and isn't just a game that takes your money. You can tell it's a very quality game with no issues which is very surprising considering how long I've played it and it keeps you coming back for more humbly. I use the word humble because it's a stress free game that just makes you happy as you play. You don't need to worry about a hundred ads, a subscription or anythin",5,1
395,E Abella,"Dolphins included! I'm the ultimate casual game player and I love everything about this game--your charges don't die and they feed themselves. You can enhance their living conditions by completing tasks, and they're always entertaining. The effects and artwork are wonderful--each penguin species is easily recognizable. Besides all this, your penguins bring presents to you and mine gold. Oh, and there are mummies and dinosaurs and orcas. I couldn't enjoy this game more.",5,1
396,Darko Pesic,"Devs are focused on Ads! And for game performance/optimization nobody cares. In my case, i have s10e, game graphics set on low and battery 100%. After 34min in game battery was on 82%, and phone is hot like never before. Same result with graphics set on high. Edit: Still no improvement in CPU load/battery department. Not even one other issue beside that.",4,1
397,Julie KS,"Simple, calming game that I can play by myself. I really like, but I have one gripe. You are allowed 30 decorations to be placed on the first landmass (if I remember correctly). Now that I've grown the land enormously, I'm only allowed 36 decorations. Why then bother creating them & having most of them in storage? There should be more decorations allowed per new landmass and a way to sell decorations we no longer want. I took a star away from my rating because of this.",4,1
398,Alyssa Williams,"This is literally the best idle game I have ever played. The penguins waddle around and live their best lives in the cutest little outfits. I just unlocked the little penguins and I have been sobbing uncontrollably for ten minutes because they are so adorable. There are only two suggestions I have for this game: more of the penguin info ads. I love them. I have learned so much about all the teeny fellas. Secondly, I would like to be able to name my 'guins so I can tell them apart.",5,1
399,Ryan Cottrell,"This game is terribly frustrating right now. I usually love it and will rate higher if bugs get patched, but this game is crashing so much. Open Halloween event, crash. Open birthday event, crash. Try and claim double coins from 10+ hours overnight, crash. Every single day. It would be so much more enjoyable if not for the constant problems right now. Edit: 1 star The crashing has only gotten worse. This version is very unstable. At least 8 crashes today so far. Wish the events would simply end",1,0
400,Theresa Valentine,I really enjoy this game compared to the fish one and like that they've finally have a way of expanding the decorations. I hope tho see more from this app as it grows and more features like maybe more interactions with the penguins or more facts I really enjoy the facts about the penguins but get tired of reading the same old information. The controls can be a little sensitive maybe adding a control for that would be nice too.,5,1
401,Desiree Murray,"Eh..... Honestly im really likeing the game... But im only giving it 2 stars for two reasons, reason one.....In order to get all the lil extra goodies (that im sure you NEED if you plan on NOT spending money) you HAVE to watch a ad... No other option.. Just ads... Wouldnt be so bad if 9 goodies didnt appear all at one time! Thats at least 10 to 12 min im watching ads instead of playing. #2... Dont give camera option if its gonna freeze EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!!! JESUS!!!",2,0
402,Z Yes,"I personally loved this game a lot. I normally don't rate games or post reviews but this particular game I found very nice. It has a calm peaceful asthetic, and the music and sound effects just make me happy. I also think that the behavior of the animals that you can have in this game are accurate and adorable. I highly recommend this game.",5,1
403,C. A.,"I would be at a five star rating if there were some kind of setting where I can toggle on/off the Christmas theme. I regret starting that quest because it's forever there now. I was emailed saying it would be removed with this recent update but .. well, still there. Edit: changed my rating as someone took the time to explain how to remove that Christmas setting. Back to my penguins.",5,1
404,Myra Boulware,"Overall I love this game. I have been playing about two weeks at this point. I have bought all the habitats (without spending real cash) and have maxed out all of my penguins. My concern is with earning hearts. If you are going to put a cap on the amount of penguins that one can have then there needs to be other ways in the game, other than buffs, to increase heart production. I am wanting to evolve my habitats another level at this point but it takes days to earn 1q hearts.",3,1
405,Sarah Caballero,"I've been playing this game for a long time now. This is the best daily game to play, truly. There is so much little stuff to do and the asthetic of the penguins is beautiful. If you are okay with watching a lot of ads the game progresses and flows nicely with no slow down. The decorations is a great add in as well. I always play this game while doing my homework because it doesn't need constant attention while progressing. You don't need to spend money on the game which is amazing for a game.",5,1
406,john,"This is a really fun little game. Technically it's another of these so called ""idle"" games but the effort that the devs put into it and how much they care about their users (and not just making money, there's only ads if you want to watch them) sets it apart from some other games I've played. Another point is simply watching the penguins, and watching them interact with the habitats. It's very well done",5,1
407,Finn Payton,"It's a fun little time-sink. I play it when I'm on the train, waiting for the bus, or just have nothing to do at home. It doesn't force microtransactions on you, which is a huge plus. The most it'll do is ask you to watch a 30 second ad for some in-game gold, and I'm happy to support the developers. Highly recommended.",5,1
408,Isaac,"Overall, good game. But here are the few issues I've encountered: - The field of view is too high and often creates a fish eye effect which is minimal but is noticeable after a few minutes of gameplay. - The HUD is too small and sometimes hard to read, having an option in settings to modify it's size would help greatly. - The particle effect used in the habitat leveling up animation causes minor lag and minor audio desync. - No main menu. (I had 2 more but not enough room for them)",3,1
409,Just Me,"I paid for the ""jewel pack upgrade"", received my pay pal receipt and the upgrade NEVER HAPPENED. I would have given this game 4.5 stars (the ads - omg! And the impossibilty to reach the emperor penguin level are my only complaint) but now, they've ripped me off & I have no idea who to contact or how to get the money back or the upgrade added. :( Too bad, I doubt I will finish it now. I loved this little game. 😞",3,1
410,Alice Archer,"This is a nice game, but its ad heavy & the lag is terrible even though I set it on lowest quality. It's a struggle just to get a response from any tap or swipe throughout the game & menus. Update- Thanks for responding. I keep my RAM clean as I can but I noticed an awful lag. I turned down the game graphics quality & it helped only a bit. When I tapped on something I had to tap a few times & wait. In the menus, scrolling was very slow. The graphics were also choppy & slow. Pretty game though!",1,0
411,Christian Pinch,"As far as idle games go, this is a perfectly serviceable example. Scales well, plenty of active stuff if you don't just want to let it run, good automation if you do. Micro- transactions are unobtrusive and seem reasonably priced. Ads are minority annoying but actively triggered and not that bad. Got to pay the bills somehow right? Overall this is one of the best idle games I've ever played, even discounting the focus on 'cute' penguins which doesn't click for me but might for others.",4,1
412,Sheridan Alice,"Great concept, but ruined by the half dozen functions that require you to watch an ad. My idea of serenity isn't watching ads every 1-2mins to make progress (some achievements are for functions that require ads). Additionally, in-app purchases are pretty expensive and don't remove or even reduce ads. A $10 remove ads option would be really nice, rather than up to $50 and still watching ads to move forward.",2,0
413,Boomdart,"Great peaceful game for playing on the side! I wish it were optimized better, it runs slow when you first open it but gets better after a minute or so. On a 5.5"" screen I can only tell a small difference between low and high graphics, I guess it's just a resolution setting? That's fine though. These niggling bits don't keep it from a 5 star rating though.",5,1
414,Dougie Bungard,"This is a great game held back heavily by its usage of ads. It has a great atmosphere, a large amount of polish, and is overall a rather fun and calm game. However, every 5-10 minutes, there are distracting boxes that appear, that give great in game bonuses, only after watching an ad. There is also no way to get rid of ads like in most mobile games. While most get rid of them after any store purchase, here you purchase coupons to skip them, or pay 30$ a month.",1,0
415,Kaia Sabino,This. Game. Is. So. Cute. You can zoom in on the penguins and it's just relaxing overall. A suggestion I would add is changing the music up every 30 minutes or so in the game 🐧🎶❄ It would be nice to have something else to do other than tapping the same coin button over and over again like some mini games or something though 🎮,4,1
416,Lucciano Scherr,It's a great game! But I'm not liking how long it's taking me to get to certain letters. I've spent almost 3 months on ao now.,3,1
417,K R,"Beautiful graphics, interesting environment, cute characterization. Annoying quirks like how it's designed to trick you into taking a screenshot for some reason (psssst, Habby, *nobody* cares.) I plan to keep going and see how it expands until the photo mode that interferes with gameplay gets to be too much. Kill that and it's worth five stars.",3,1
418,Juan Menendez,"The game is relaxing as people say. Beyond growing your island, though, there's nothing else to the game. What really bothers me is that you can't progress at a decent rate without ads or buying gems. Even if you're patient, the game keeps the ad notifications (ship and gifts) in your face until you give in.",2,0
419,Tomás González Aragón,"Addictive, fun at first, frustrating later on. The game is basically an ad-watching simulator. You need to watch lots of ads to be able to progress. Game doesn't require skill at all, it's a game to relax if you've got nothing better to do while you're waiting in line for something.",2,0
420,adam davis,Hey so gold and hearts don't seem to be accumulating while the game is closed. Unless the screen is open nothing is happening. Is that normal? Also yes I've upgraded stuff to auto collect... Edit...I figured it out. That hour glass thing holds the stuff until you click it. Sometimes it takes a minute to figure things out.,4,1
421,Chris E,"Cute penguins and a fun game but the math makes no sense. Gold and percentages seem arbitrary. Upgrade numbers don't add up, neither does the money letter system. Just isn't fun after a while because there's no strategy involved, it's just whatever they want you to be at and the longer you go, the more you'll have to pay to even get close to some of the achievements. As well, the longer you play, the longer it takes ads to load so you'll wait 30 seconds for the button and 25 more for the ad.",2,0
422,Sara Groom,Its a wonderful lazy tap game. I love its simplistic design and the little crafting. The adverts that most games have actually work for you in earning actual progress with suitable rewards instead of being in your face. My lack of a 5 star (though I wish I could go half star as this isn't a big issue) is that the packages to buy for extra gems and whatnot is rather expensive. And the current event special package is also a touch much. However its not a pay to win by any means.,4,1
423,Emily Elizabeth,"Fun, simple, and relaxing to play. As someone who loves penguins I had to try out this game. I'm only a few hours into it and so far I'm really liking it. The penguins are adorable and the music is very calming. A great game to play if you're feeling ill or depressed and need a little serotonin boost that doesn't require much effort. 💙",5,1
424,Katz of Void,"Very relaxing and peaceful. First off, I love penguins, so this game was interesting to start!! Second, I have high anxiety, and this game helps me calm down when I need to most! The music is so peaceful and the animals are adorable! If you're looking for a calm, relaxing game, this game is definitely for you!",5,1
425,Jessica Nicholl,"This is probably the cutest game I've ever played! I have been playing it for months and I still smile every time I click on a penguin and it honks and flaps its wings, lol. Great graphics, very laid back but still engaging enough to keep you playing. I've unlocked all the areas and purchased all of the penguins but I'm still playing bc it just makes me smile.",5,1
426,Brandi Tinsley,"This game is amazing. I have played other games similar to this and while I enjoy those I always had a hard time with the layout, but this game is perfect. I find it easy to navigate and easy to advance without having to spend real money. One of my biggest pet peeves with games is when you get to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without buying some sort of pack, but this game doesn't do that. It's also really cute and the look of the game keeps me entertained. I love it!!!",5,1
427,TEKL,"Update: Bumped up from 2 to 4 stars. I realized dev is correct. This is listed as being a soothing relaxed game which is why dl'ed it in the first place. It's pretty, has nice music and perfect for someone wanting to chill out with a mellow game. Original rating: 2 stars It was fun for a very short time then way too much wait time to get anything.",4,1
428,Jonathan Allan,Fun but the late game can drag if you don't use gems on chests for upgrades. The art style and tone are my favorite parts of the game. I could see some people saying the game is ad heavy but I think it's comparable or better than most games in this category. I recommend it.,5,1
429,TheBigbass317,"very calming and very fun game! it has a few problems that make it less enjoyable, but overall its a fun experience! my biggest suggestion to the developers is to add a camera mode where you can move the view freely up and down, and side to side so that you can frame better looking shots",3,1
430,Matthew Lewis,This would be a really good game but the lag just kills it. Someone put a lot of time into developing it but the lag makes it almost impossible to play. Screens don't or won't scroll and sometimes bonus money just disappears. I really hope they can fix it. It would have been a 4 or 5 star game.,3,1
431,Mackintoshtosh,"Absolutely love this game. It's really fun and there's adorable options and gameplay never ends. The only thing I wish was different is the pricing for events passes. Events happen so often (no complaints there since they're super fun) but the price of event passes kind of deter me from buying them. For an idle app, $10 for events feels like a bit much but I like at least having the option of small rewards without a pass",4,1
432,Opal Littman,"I kinda just go around testing games for fun. But this game is outstanding, I had to keep it. It is so fun and the penguins are so cute. Yes, there are adds here and there to earn things but that is no problem for me.i love that you can take pictures of the penguins and earn so much money for that. Overall the best game yet. I am addicted.",5,1
433,Matthew Carlson,"App won't load, developer is stupid. Brand new Google Pixel 4 1) Install app 2) Try to run app 3) App tries to connect to my Google Play Games profile, but it's stuck loading. 4) Uninstall and reinstall 5) Repeat steps 3-4 a couple times 6) Emailed the developer with: - my issue - my symptoms - my device specs The developer emailed me back and said something like,""Please check the network or reinstall and try again. Thank you for playing."" I'm not playing, idiots...",1,0
434,Steven Soviet,"Top tier idle game that rivals abyssrium in my opinion only problem is the pass for the other half of the first anneversary items are paid and there is no way to use gems to purchase the pass for say example 10000 gems. I think making it purchaseable by gems and with money because free to play players will have to save up mostly watching the ads to accumalate that many gems, and the devs make money either way. Do consider making the event passes also purchaseable with some high amount of gems.",5,1
435,Jaime Herrman,I love this game. It's a lot of fun and has the perfect balance of advancement vs the time it takes to work toward it. I have over 50 games on my phone and this one is by far my favorite after only a short time playing it. Penguins are my favorite animal and this is the only penguin game I've actually enjoyed. Heavily recommend.,5,1
436,Lucas Schmidt,Fun at first but progress becomes severely dimished after reaching the hot air balloon. A prestige system other than penguin hearts is definitely needed. A lot of the things that make the game unique become dull because the amount of penguins that can be spawned is capped and the amount of props is capped at 30 rendering crafting useless after a few days of playing.,3,1
437,retired one,"The game is beautifu and has a very unique perspective when it comes to idle games. However, the game is very laggy and the camera angles and zoom are a bit difficut at best, possibly becaus of the lag. If these issues are improved I'll have no problem changing my rating to a five 5. I can't wait to see what else the devs have coming for this title.",4,1
438,Jessica Key-Olmsted,"This game was amazing. I got to play it for a few days and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, after I transferred the app to my SD card, it would load and then crash. I will definitely reinstall if that bug is fixed. Keeping it in internal storage isn't an option due to limited space so it needs to be able to run while stored in external memory. I really hope this is resolved as I would LOVE to keep playing. Thanks!",3,1
439,Kenneth Tarmann,"The game is cute and innocent at the beginning and yes, you could theoretically just sit and watch a lone penguin wander around but you can also just sit and watch Mario stand around. There are no interactions beside placing decorations, you have no control over penguin actions and your phone will become a non-stop ad streaming machine before you are anywhere near halfway through the achievement list. The more you add to your island the faster the game will eat your battery even on eco mode.",2,0
440,Jen,"I really liked this at the start because it was pretty easy to level up. I loved the satisfaction of getting new penguins and environments for them. And then things started to get leaps and bounds more expensive and I was maxing out on penguins before I could get more environments. The Whales Nest is proving very difficult to get to and it's making me want to play the game less and less, since progress has grinded to a halt on all fronts",4,1
441,Maria Cabrera,"This game is so beautiful!! I just started out and it's great. There are no lives (for example, five lives in candy crush) so you can play all day. It's calming. The music is beautiful and it feels great to build my own world. There are ads only if you want the bonuses that come up, but they aren't invasive at all. Totally recommend!!!",5,1
442,Synonym Roll,"This is a great little game. Very calming music/ambience, charming graphics, and progression has felt pretty good. However, the progression is heavily tied to watching ads, which can be a little frustrating. I would absolutely pay for instant gift box rewards without ads. A fun mobile game overall!",4,1
443,Ally Ketch,"I give it three stars because I do enjoy this game, however. It's stopped letting me view ads. Ads aren't a thing that bothers me, the black screen with the white X block bother me. I'm not getting my rewards from watching ads and I'm losing the opportunity to earn said reward. I've uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled and tried with and without WiFi. Nothing seems to work.",3,1
444,Tracie Scheel,"I thoroughly enjoy this game! It's really well done as an idle game so you don't have to tend to it constantly, but there are things you can do if you want. Not to mention it's absolutely adorable and the penguins are accurate to their real life counterparts! I even enjoy zooming in and just watching them waddle around. Such a cute game, and well executed!",5,1
445,Vanessa McGrane,"I love this game! I love how u can keep growing ur island, but a lot of things are expensive. One more thing I dont really care for is u cant really move ur screen to see all the different glaciers. Other than that, I think it is a great way to spend ur extra time.",4,1
446,Don Van,"You start to hit a wall around the 12th Habitat unlocked. By this point, penguin upgrades are now maxed out. You're forced to watch 30 second ads every 5 minutes in order to progress. Or do the quests that will require you to check your phone every 2 minutes for boxes which defeats the purpose of an idle game...",2,0
447,kal P,"It's very slow and repetitive, the graphics and music are beautiful but there are way too many ads it makes the game almost unplayable that's the majjn reason I'm u installing, I spent about 4 dollars on In game purchases and I'm sure with no ads more people would buy stuff tooif ads were removed, the ads are way too much! Also the game does not have any specific challanges, you literally just click on stuff to redeem rewards and watch ads (the same ads over and over) theirs no challanges....",1,0
448,Alejandro Baldemoore,"+3 stars coz I am hooked on this game. -1 star coz the other islands dissapear from frame when zoomed out. I saved and gave a lot of time for those islands to be hidden. -1 star coz you can only play it PORTRAIT MODE. It doesnt flip to Landscape mode, which doesnt make sense coz with all the islands to be completed, it would fit on landscape mode. I hate it that I have to scroll back and forth so much to scan my islands and see my penguins in one glance. Zoomed out they all look like blackdots",3,1
449,jsho574,"The experience of Penguin Isle is mostly good. There are ads involved but I overall enjoyed the system implemented as the reward increases to be temping most of the time. They also give you plenty of the free currency in game through quest. The negatives, you only have 150 mins of idle time collection when you are away. I understand why there would be a limit to it but a higher number like 300 would really be rewarding to come back to or let me upgrade the idle time. It really drains battery.",4,1
450,Yoda Man,"A nice, cute, and relaxing game. The reason for 1 star is simple -- the pricing in the store is everything wrong with mobile gaming. To get all the packages, it would cost just under $111, which is more than a vastly-superior current-gen console game, and this is after watching TONS of ads. If the cost was like 10-20% of what it is now, it would be a lot more reasonable. And $30 a MONTH for no ads?! 🤬 STOP LOCKING HOLIDAY STUFF BEHIND PAY WALLS, YOU GREEDY ****S!",1,0
451,The Ocanas Boyz,"Love the game. I'm pretty far into it, but lately the only quests I've been getting are to level up the fishing spot. Problem is it currently costs 160.73cb for 1 level up on the fishing spot and everything else is at 31.58cb. Also I'm only making 6.74ca, this wouldn't really be a problem but I'm using all of my gems to buy creatures instead of chests like normal. Only got the Lucky Bag, Rudolph, Bell and Xmass Tree penguins left got all the rest even the recipe.",5,1
452,gabe,"This is literally my favorite game. Its calming, it's cute, and the frequent updates help add to the playability. It's so refreshing to have a game where I dont feel like I'm being constantly explioted so random app developers can make money. With this game I'm happy to watch a few ads when I feel like it because its supporting people who made something that can be such a source for joy.",5,1
453,Kaori Ibinyopakaka,"Best game ever so calming and relaxing but can there be like a puzzle or game that you can do to earn coins, also can you make a dress up option so you can dress up the worker penguins in different outfits that go with there job. I say worker penguin 🐧 because the citizen penguin would take so long cause I have so much penguins so please only the workers I don't want you guys to put too much work cause you already did. Either way I give this 5000000000000000 stars ✨",5,1
454,Gaki Aqaa,"This is one of the best time passing games I've played to date. The style is beautiful and while the mechanics aren't the most original there's still something so unique and charming about it. It's simple, keeps you busy, is weirdly calming, and down right freaking adorable.",5,1
455,Domonic Thomas,"It's like Egg Inc., but less work (you don't have to break your thumb constantly pumping out more chickens) as everything is automated (once you level up enough and that feature comes fairly early), the soothing music is definitely a plus, the penguins (I must admit) are much more adorable looking than chickens lol, and you don't have to prestige out and start all over. I've only been playing for less than a day now, but this one looks like a keeper 👍. Less ads and I would've given 5 stars.",4,1
456,Meadow Violet,"Update: Changed 3 to 4. If you don't like adds, you don't have to click. Just clicking the hearts above the penguins, listening to the music, and watching different penguins and animals walking around is relaxing. Love the game, but the decorations area is glitchy. It says I have less than 30 items active, but says I'm at my max of 30. I removed all but 2 decorations, but it says I have 7 active. If not for this frustrating issue, I'd give it a 5 for music, relaxation, and beautiful graphics.",4,1
457,Matthew,"This is such an amazing game, I absolutely recommend it! The music is so nice and the game in general is super relaxing. It's not at all hard to figure out, and best of all, there aren't any ads interrupting gameplay. The only ads you encounter are ones you choose to watch to get things that you can get without them, although it's faster with the ads. Everything about the game looks great, and it's super cute as well!",5,1
458,Ikayuro,"I really want to love this game; I do. But after you unlock the antarctic base, as another reviewer said, any forward progress just stops. You can't buy more penguins, which means you have a low heart gain, so you can't upgrade the exhibits, and the penguins cost too much more to level compared to what they give back. I get that the developers probably did it on purpose, but this game just becomes a question of ""how many ads do I feel like watching today?"" And the fun is lost.",2,0
459,Kathleen Tolbert,"Relaxing game. Cute penguins. What more do you need to know. Note: the game does reach a point where it takes a long time to build up the coins needed to expand the island. But, there are a lot of cute objects to build and decorate your current islands with and the developers have included mini-games that make it worth logging into the app each day for five minutes.",5,1
460,carlos Palacios,I was genuinely happy to see that after watching who knows how many ads I was able to upgrade a few things with the latest update. No the developers punished me taking me back the awful grind just to level one thing. Honestly is just pure disappointment. After spending so much time on this game. The tease we had was the breaking point for me. Just delete the app. There's better apps out there that won't punish you for their mistake.,1,0
461,Brent Roraback,UPDATE: Unplayable on a Pixel 3a. No dynamic content will load. Crashes in 30 seconds or less. Guessing it has to do with the ads SDK (anything ad related seems to cause a crash before any ad content loads). Uninstalled. I like the game but for the past few days it's been crashing constantly. I'm lucky if it will stay open for 90 seconds. (Running Android 11 on a Pixel 3a),1,0
462,.,"the penguins and other creatures are very cute, it's entertaining just watching them. the game itself is very simple and relaxing, although you do kind of have to watch ads just to make any progress. however, it's such a cozy game I really don't mind supporting the devs. looking forward to the new event!",5,1
463,Al Manzil,"I gave 5 star before but not anymore. Everything was going well. I don't know what happened with the upset that resulted being reverted back. But after that even with all the ""free"" gifts, my whole game is messed up. I'm super stuck my heart is stuck. The next upgrade for heart, gold is so far away. This ""reverted update"", messed my whole game up. I spend literally countless hours in last 3-4 days to get where I am so I can get my last two island as quick as possible. I feel so sad it's all wast",1,0
464,Alex Pemberton,"I personally don't mind the ads, it's a enjoyable relaxing game and if we are just idling on an idle game we might as well watch an ad or two, the devs deserve some monetization. The major problem I have with this game is that ever since I redownloaded it a few days ago and used up my ad tickets, the watch ad button has been greyed out and I have been unable to watch any ads at all, drastically slowing down any progress I would get from the ship or heart gift box. Please fix!",3,1
465,Zachary Furman,I love this game I play it every night before bed to collect everything. However I knocked stars for a few reasons. 1 youre going to have to watch a minimum of 7 adds to collect everything & quite often. 2 the new updates are adding tons of cool items & thats awesome! But the limit of items on the map is only 30. Thats nothing when some items take up to 5 slots. Also they recently updated that you can purchase more than 20 penguins of the same species but limited the map. And few other reasons.,3,1
466,Kara Yamori,"Responsible use of ads, all voluntarily and give a pretty decent rewards. Worth sitting through to help your little penguins and support the developer. 12 ads gives $1 worth of gems on top of the other goodies you get from it, not that bad at all, there's no pressure to pay for anything. Gameplay is your typical idle/clicker but with penguins! If you're into idles and love penguins it's worth trying. Has the feel of a meditative idle.",5,1
467,Chloe,"It's so calming and really helps with my anxiety. After a long day it's so great to play this game and just take care of my penguins and my animals! The challenges are hard but not so hard that they're discouraging, you can complete them without having to spend money on stuff like other apps. The graphics and art style are super cute too. This is honestly my favorite app/game I've ever downloaded!",5,1
468,Rhiannon De Falco,If I could give this game more than 5 stars I would. The penguins are ridiculously adorable. It's super easy to upgrade. It's your choice to watch ads and when you do you always get something for it. Cool events too! The best part is watching the penguins interact with the island and items you put down. Huge props to the creators for all the wonderful small details that make this game so wonderful to play. 💗,5,1
469,Noelle Natoli,"The rating I would give the app is 4 out of 5 stars. The app is described in the app store as a relaxing and healing game with a comforting melody of music and ocean waves playing in the background and rated is E for everyone. The game has no consequences as you are just decorating, upgrading, and hatching penguins on the iceberg. This accompanied with the calming music, sound of waves and cute penguins make for a very relaxing game/app.",4,1
470,Elijah Filice,"Overall, this game is very similar to the My Oasis and Abbysirum games; hence, it is very entertaining and engaging. However, as a recommendation to the developers, could you make the habitats and overall aesthetic a bit more realistic? The humanlike habitat penguins look bizzare next to the realistic movements of the regular penguins. An improvement I would like to see in particular would be changing the fisherpenguin's design, making it dive for fish like a real penguin instead of using a rod.",5,1
471,dzlandis,"I love this game! It's like the cure to depression. If your going through a hard time because of COVID-19, this is the game for you. The music is calm and relaxing and the gameplay is smooth and intuitive. This game is so amazing that it made me right a review because I can't control how much I love it. I don't usually write reviews. The ad count is just right and barely noticeable. Seriously, download this game! It's the cure to life.",5,1
472,Christina Bridwell,"So I find the game very relaxing and fun to watch but why in the world would you give so many decorating items , so many choices! Limit the items you can actually decorate with and then have an event that offers more decorateing items! Fix this so you can decorate all of the islands and you what you build and I will change to 5 stars but not until. And I sure wont spend money on it until then.",1,0
473,Zangst,"I enjoy this casual game, but during events, daily event items don't reset. You end up watching pointless ads for a few measly amount of items. Example, the daily Sakura leaves are supposed to reset every 24 hours after you've claimed them. Its been 3 days, and the counter still says 10.5 hours! How can you save up for the event penguins if you're having to spend all your leaves on the quests? No way am I spending my gems for it. Support is nonexistent too. No reply to issues u encounter.",2,0
474,Violet,"A personal favorite! It doesn't inturrupt you with ads, but can speed up gameplay by choosing to watch some for perks. This is an app I would genuinely consider spending on (if I had money to do so) because of its uninvasive approach. It's calming and easygoing; something which other apps can learn from.",5,1
475,Jackson Downing,"I love this game, it's very calming and fun. Definitely a 5 star experience, except for the ads. I get that ads make money, but they can be invasive sometimes. For example, I have a quest to use a whale summon which you have to watch an ad for. I can't skip it and I can't progress without it. Other than that minor inconvenience, 5 star game. With that inconvenience, 4 star game",4,1
476,LaughingElite,I love this game. Its cute fun and overall just a joy to play. Barely any ads at all. But I have 1 big problem with the game. Everytime I watch an ad to claim a prize my game crashes and I don't get the money. Its been an issue in other games too but I can't really progress much because of it. If they fix this I would give 5 stars.,3,1
477,Ry Guy,The game has great graphics and music but the advertisements are the only way you can get real advancement after a while. At least 40% of the game consists of watching advertisements. It kind of loses a lot of the initial charm after you unlock the first three habitats. It's still a great game but it would be perfect without the ads.,3,1
478,William Mauritsen,"Awesome game, I cant stop playing it. The penguins are very funny and the colors in the game are very calming. One thing I noticed that was wrong was the movement of the penguins when transitioning to a higher elevation, swimming, and sliding is a little bit sloppy and not so life like. Other than that, cool game!",5,1
479,Christopher Borchers,"The most recent inclusion of a battle pass system disguised as a 'Summer Holiday Event' shows that this game is trying to be more than what it is. The greatest shame is that no one asked for this. Where I would have bragged of this game's elegance and simplicity only two days ago, now I would hesitate to recommend it. It does what it does well and deserves no less than 3 stars, but be on the lookout for more instances where this game intends to sellout and chase hype rather than vision.",3,1
480,Dee Bailey,"I have been playing this game since it came out but, as another poster stated, it is no longer fun because I cannot progress any further in the game. I keep upgrading my habitats but no progress in a couple of months. And I am not sure about the Workshop. That is pretty boring. It would be nice if the items that are being built could be sold. I am at a standstill so it seems pointless to keep playing anymore. This game could still be a great game if the developers would make some changes to make progression easier. For now, I will be moving on to another game. Sure will miss my penguins though.",2,0
481,Jackie Skotnik,"I like the game. Customer service is lacking. I reported an apparent glitch. I was given the brush off. Finally after several emails, my husband - a software developer - emailed. Every time I created a new regular penguin, I lost a regular penguin. This kept raising the price of penguins, so I've been losing money. The game won't tell you you've reached the max on penguins and let's you keep creating without any warning about losing penguins. This is ""current game design."" Bad form!",2,0
482,Dana,"Cute game! It's fun to watch the penguins and build their home. Ads are annoying and are entirely optional but gets you free ""premium"" content. One issue or bug I noticed is sometimes after the ad is finished, the ambient game music doesn't go back on and I have to switch it on manually on the decorating menu. Hoping the developers can fix that in an update.",4,1
483,T. Payne,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, I loooove penguins! However this game is riddled with glitches and some of them can be malicious and game ruining. Recently a timer for an event glitched and I missed out on the last items in the event because I believed I had more time to complete it. I emailed the developer and they gave me a few gems as compensation but didn't seem to care at all that I was missing the items that I had actually paid money for. After that I couldn't go back.",1,0
484,Daniel Griffith,"It's beautiful and calming until you realize it's just an enticement to watch as many ads as you can to make progress. I played until my coins were in the i/j/k level. It was fun while it lasted, but when I realized that I *wanted* to watch ads, I knew it was over. I have no other issues with it. It's very well done.",3,1
485,James Mustain,"This is a great little game. It's beautiful. All of the ads here are optional and rewarded with a bonus, no forced ad viewing. The game is reasonably fun. It's really neat to see the penguins moving little trinkets around to decorate while you play.",4,1
486,Maree McLerran,this game is so relaxing but it keeps you on your toes at the same time! the graphics are so cute and it's a lot of fun because it's easy but challenging too! this game is perfect because you don't have to play it 24/7 but you can if you want and it won't get boring! i absolutely recommend this game 11/10 stars🤩💖,5,1
487,Tae Park,"Fun and reasonable amount of ad. It will stay as 5 stars as long as the game lets me enjoy the game. I understand I need to click ad to stay playing free. I will help the dev team as much as I can by clicking ads gladly, as long as they stay reasonable with me. Thank you for a beautiful game.",5,1
488,grace sherman,"This game is amazing. Period. With the calming music and enviroment, plus the adorable way the penguins interact, makes a unique experience. I have just started the game, so there is nothing I can complain about so far. Keep doing what you do and keep making an incredible experience!",5,1
489,A T,"Don't waste your time paying for the events. I paid for the Summer Event. It was stated that the event was from 7-20 to 8-19. I played every day until the 18. I had 15 + chest earned and was saving them to open all at once on August 19. I opened the game on AUGUST 18 at 6:30 pm. The event was gone, along with all my chests and the money I spent for the pass and extra lime. I sent a bug report, I sent an email straight to the developer. Both have been ignored. I guess it's time for game deletion.",1,0
490,Michael Shostack,"Good graphics but the only gameplay is tapping a single button to advance slowly unless you pay or watch ads to add anything interesting to your island other than penguins. Needs more ways to advance without that. Also, the same copy pasted response from dev on these reviews is lame. We get it. Email you. You're adding things to your list (but will never add them unless they increase ad/gem revenue) blablabla. Edit: dev pasted the same copypasta garbage response as expected.",2,0
491,Burger Poochy,"This might be the most relaxing and enjoyable game to do with penguins I have ever played. When a penguin does its job it produces a resource that the other penguins either way, swim in, or use to add on the the middle den thingy. For instance, the flower garden makes flowers, and the gravel yard makes gravel. The graphics are pretty good, and the gameplay is very fun. I highly recommend this game.",5,1
492,Fred Mitchell,There is an issue I had last time I tried this game that is still around. When I get to the point where there is a hand telling you to click something the tutorial glitches and the hand sticks around but is unresponsive to anything including logging out. I am unable to use some of the features in the game because of this old bug.,3,1
493,Some Dude,"The game has become more and more cashgrabby. Used to love this game months ago, but now you're locking content behind a paywall, and a large paywall for just some decorations that you still have to put the work it to get. So not only do you have to bay $10 for it, you also have to spend hours and likely gems to get all of it.",1,0
494,Luciana Dhillon,"I love this game! There are no ads unless you want them. For example you can get a chest with loads of money in it but you have to watch an ad. This is my favorite feature in the game because most games are filled with ads! One thing I thought was confusing was the money. It goes by the alphabet instead of 10,100,1000 ect. Overall this game is awesome 😎",5,1
495,John Abassian,"Ads! You can't play this game without watching 30+second ads for every 30 seconds of ""gameplay"". You grind and grind as everything gets exponentially more expensive, which would be fine if the game cannot be continued because the research points are held hostage by actions that require long tedious terrible ads. You spend more time watching ads than grinding for very little reward, watching cute little animated penguins. Don't worry you can block ads for a monthly fee that's more than Xbox live",1,0
496,Michele Whalin-Hagey,"This is without doubt (in my opinion) the BEST Idle/Clicker Game I've installed so far!!! Great graphics, sound, in-app purchases are reasonably priced. I would also like to mention and thank the developers for the low amount of ads. ""THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF ADS!!!"" Most clicker/idle apps have an abundance of ads. If I could...I would Post 10☆'s",5,1
497,Nick Myers,"I love the game. It's fun watching everything happen and what the penguins are up to. I have two problems: 1. Offline reward pops up maybe half the time now. 2. Video ads have been failing to load this making it difficult to collect the whale or gift box. *Edit* latest update, the offline for hearts is not correct. I earn hearts at 0.5p/minute and my offline time is 510 minutes. I should earn ~255p hearts in that time but it's showing ~90p for that time. Please help!",5,1
498,Paige The Nerd,"Good concept but very faulty. Has room for improvement. Every time I take a picture, the app doesn't let me get back to the game. It doesn't freeze, but it just stops. The game also runs REALLY slow for its simple design. Zooming in and out is also a hassle because the pinches are so small.",2,0
499,The_Ramen_Weeb,"I just installed this game and its awesome. I played a game exactly like this and its more serene and beautiful. The golden chest didnt work but its probably a glitch, it happens sometimes with all games. I recommend playing this game if you want a calm and nice idle game.",5,1
